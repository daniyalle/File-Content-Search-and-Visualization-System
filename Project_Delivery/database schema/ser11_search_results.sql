Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor.\nOver 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 Î¼m (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.\nMost living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The vast majority belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes, which includes organisms such as the arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include the echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains the vertebrates. The simple Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria. \nAnimals first appear in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period, and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran. Earlier evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated all the way back to the Tonian period, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested.[5] Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.\nHistorically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.\nHumans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs and dairy products), for materials (such as leather, fur and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey, while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics and sports.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived from Latin animalis \'having breath or soul\'.[6] The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.[7] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.[8][9][10][11] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek Î¼ÎµÏ„Î± (meta) \'after\' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for \'later\') and Î¶á¿·á¾° (zÅia) \'animals\', plural of Î¶á¿·Î¿Î½ zÅion \'animal\'.[12][13]\n\nCharacteristics\nAnimals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early embryo (1) develop into a hollow ball or blastula (2).\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular.[14] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients,[15] animals are heterotrophic,[16][17] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.[18] With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.[a][20] All animals are motile[21] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.[22]\n\nStructure\nAll animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.[23] During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.[24] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.[25] Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.[26]\nWith few exceptionsâ€”in particular, the sponges and placozoansâ€”animal bodies are differentiated into tissues.[27] These include muscles, which enable locomotion, and nerve tissues, which transmit signals and coordinate the body. Typically, there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians).[28]\n\nReproduction and development\nSee also: Sexual reproduction Â§ Animals, and Asexual reproduction Â§ Examples in animals\nSexual reproduction is nearly universal in animals, such as these dragonflies.\nNearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.[29] They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.[30] These fuse to form zygotes,[31] which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge.[32] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.[33] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm.[34] In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them.[35] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.[36]\nRepeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits.[37][38] Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding.[39]\nSome animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids.[40][41]\n\nEcology\nPredators, such as this ultramarine flycatcher (Ficedula superciliaris), feed on other animals.\nAnimals are categorised into ecological groups depending on their trophic levels and how they consume organic material. Such groupings include carnivores (further divided into subcategories such as piscivores, insectivores, ovivores, etc.), herbivores (subcategorized into folivores, graminivores, frugivores, granivores, nectarivores, algivores, etc.), omnivores, fungivores, scavengers/detritivores,[42] and parasites.[43] Interactions between animals of each biome form complex food webs within that ecosystem. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumerâ€“resource interaction where the predator feeds on another organism, its prey,[44] who often evolves anti-predator adaptations to avoid being fed upon. Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various antagonistic/competitive coevolutions.[45][46] Almost all multicellular predators are animals.[47] Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts\' living tissues, killing them in the process,[48] but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers.[49] Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles which mainly eat sponges.[50]\n\nHydrothermal vent mussels and shrimps\nMost animals rely on biomass and bioenergy produced by plants and phytoplanktons (collectively called producers) through photosynthesis. Herbivores, as primary consumers, eat the plant material directly to digest and absorb the nutrients, while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels   indirectly acquire the nutrients by eating the herbivores or other animals that have eaten the herbivores. Animals oxidize carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and other biomolecules, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain basal metabolism and fuel other biological processes such as locomotion.[51][52][53] Some benthic animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter produced through chemosynthesis (via oxidizing inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide) by archaea and bacteria.[54]\nAnimals evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician.[55] Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago.[56][57] Animals occupy virtually all of earth\'s habitats and microhabitats, with faunas adapted to salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other organisms.[58] Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 Â°C (122 Â°F)[59] or in the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica.[60]\n\nDiversity\nSize\nFurther information: Largest organisms and Smallest organisms\nThe blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived.\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long.[61][62][63] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes[61] and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long.[61] The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and Supersaurus which may have reached 39 meters.[64][65] Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 Î¼m,[66] and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 Î¼m when fully grown.[67]\n\nNumbers and habitats of major phyla\nThe following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla,[68] along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water,[69] and marine),[70] and free-living or parasitic ways of life.[71] Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000â€“27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000â€“20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million.[72] Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal speciesâ€”including those not yet describedâ€”was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[73][74][b]\n\n\n\nPhylum\n\nExample\n\nDescribed species\n\nLand\n\nSea\n\nFreshwater\n\nFree-living\n\nParasitic\n\n\nArthropoda\n\n\n\n1,257,000[68]\n\nYes 1,000,000(insects)[76]\n\nYes >40,000(Malac-ostraca)[77]\n\nYes 94,000[69]\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes >45,000[c][71]\n\n\nMollusca\n\n\n\n85,000[68]107,000[78]\n\nYes 35,000[78]\n\nYes 60,000[78]\n\nYes 5,000[69]12,000[78]\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes >5,600[71]\n\n\nChordata\n\n\n\n>70,000[68][79]\n\nYes 23,000[80]\n\nYes 13,000[80]\n\nYes 18,000[69]9,000[80]\n\nYes\n\nYes 40(catfish)[81][71]\n\n\nPlatyhelminthes\n\n\n\n29,500[68]\n\nYes[82]\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes 1,300[69]\n\nYes[70]\n3,000â€“6,500[83]\n\n\nYes >40,000[71]\n4,000â€“25,000[83]\n\n\n\nNematoda\n\n\n\n25,000[68]\n\nYes (soil)[70]\n\nYes 4,000[72]\n\nYes 2,000[69]\n\nYes11,000[72]\n\nYes 14,000[72]\n\n\nAnnelida\n\n\n\n17,000[68]\n\nYes (soil)[70]\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes 1,750[69]\n\nYes\n\nYes 400[71]\n\n\nCnidaria\n\n\n\n16,000[68]\n\n\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes (few)[70]\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes >1,350(Myxozoa)[71]\n\n\nPorifera\n\n\n\n10,800[68]\n\n\n\nYes[70]\n\n200â€“300[69]\n\nYes\n\nYes[84]\n\n\nEchinodermata\n\n\n\n7,500[68]\n\n\n\nYes 7,500[68]\n\n\n\nYes[70]\n\n\n\n\nBryozoa\n\n\n\n6,000[68]\n\n\n\nYes[70]\n\nYes 60â€“80[69]\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nRotifera\n\n\n\n2,000[68]\n\n\n\nYes >400[85]\n\nYes 2,000[69]\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNemertea\n\n\n\n1,350[86][87]\n\n\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTardigrada\n\n\n\n1,335[68]\n\nYes[88](moist plants)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of described extant species as of 2013[update]: 1,525,728[68]\n\nEvolutionary origin\nFurther information: Urmetazoan\nEvidence of animals is found as long ago as the Cryogenian period. 24-Isopropylcholestane (24-ipc) has been found in rocks from roughly 650 million years ago; it is only produced by sponges and pelagophyte algae. Its likely origin is from sponges based on molecular clock estimates for the origin of 24-ipc production in both groups. Analyses of pelagophyte algae consistently recover a Phanerozoic origin, while analyses of sponges recover a Neoproterozoic origin, consistent with the appearance of 24-ipc in the fossil record.[89][90]\nThe first body fossils of animals appear in the Ediacaran, represented by forms such as Charnia and Spriggina. It had long been doubted whether these fossils truly represented animals,[91][92][93] but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature.[94] Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.[95]\nMany animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale.[96] Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artifact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.[97][98][99][100] That view is supported by the discovery of Auroralumina attenboroughii, the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557â€“562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predators, catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do.[101]\nSome palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.[102] Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges.[103]\nTrace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms.[104] However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution.[105][106] Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals.[107] Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures.[108][109]\n\n\n\n\nDickinsonia costata from the Ediacaran biota (c. 635â€“542 mya) is one of the earliest animal species known.[94]\n\n\n\nAuroralumina attenboroughii, an Ediacaran predator (c. 560 mya)[101]\n\n\n\nAnomalocaris canadensis is one of the many animal species that emerged in the Cambrian explosion, starting some 539 mya, and found in the fossil beds of the Burgess shale.\n\n\nPhylogeny\nFurther information: Lists of animals\nExternal phylogeny\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are the sister group to the choanoflagellates, with which they form the Choanozoa.[110]  \nThe dates on the phylogenetic tree indicate approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split.[111][112][113][114][115]\nRos-Rocher and colleagues (2021) trace the origins of animals to unicellular ancestors, providing the external phylogeny shown in the cladogram. Uncertainty of relationships is indicated with dashed lines.[116]\n\n\n\n\nOpisthokonta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolomycota (inc. fungi) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolozoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIchthyosporea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPluriformea \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilozoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilasterea \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoanozoa\n\n\n\n\n\nChoanoflagellatea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimalia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n760 mya\n\n\n\n950 mya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1100 mya\n\n\n\n1300 mya\n\nInternal phylogeny\nThe most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa, have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry. Their relationships are still disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the Ctenophora,[117] both of which lack hox genes, which are important for body plan development.[118]\nHox genes are found in the Placozoa,[119][120] Cnidaria,[121] and Bilateria.[122][123] 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in the Precambrian. 25 of these are novel core gene groups, found only in animals; of those, 8 are for essential components of the Wnt and TGF-beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for the body\'s system of axes (in three dimensions), and another 7 are for transcription factors including homeodomain proteins involved in the control of development.[124][125]\nGiribet and Edgecombe (2020) provide what they consider to be a consensus internal phylogeny of the animals, embodying uncertainty about the structure at the base of the tree (dashed lines).[126]\n\n\n\n\nAnimalia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorifera \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtenophora \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaHoxozoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacozoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCnidaria \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilateria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenacoelomorpha \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNephrozoa\n\n\n\n\n\nDeuterostomia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbulacraria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChordata \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtostomia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcdysozoa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpiralia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblastopore mouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsymm. embryo\n\n\n\nhox genes\n\n\n\nmulticellular\n\nAn alternative phylogeny, from Kapli and colleagues (2021), proposes a clade Xenambulacraria for the Xenacoelamorpha + Ambulacraria; this is either within Deuterostomia, as sister to Chordata, or the Deuterostomia are recovered as paraphyletic, and Xenambulacraria is sister to the proposed clade Centroneuralia, consisting of Chordata + Protostomia.[127]\n\nNon-bilateria\nNon-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background).\nSeveral animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. These are the Porifera (sea sponges), Placozoa, Cnidaria (which includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals), and Ctenophora (comb jellies).\nSponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a sister clade to all other animals.[128] Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are.[129][130] Sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla;[131] their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals.[132] They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out small particles of food.[133]\nThe comb jellies and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus.[134] Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete organs.[135] They are diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm.[136]\nThe tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae.[137][138] Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research.[129][139]\n\nBilateria\nMain articles: Bilateria and Symmetry (biology) Â§ Bilateral symmetry\nIdealised bilaterian body plan.[d] With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head. Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable peristaltic motion.\nThe remaining animals, the great majorityâ€”comprising some 29 phyla and over a million speciesâ€”form a clade, the Bilateria, which have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria are triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side.[140][141]\nHaving a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body;[141] these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis.[142] They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.[140][141]\nGenetic studies have considerably changed zoologists\' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes.[143] It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade Nephrozoa[144][145][146] However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians.[127]\n\n\nProtostomes and deuterostomes\nFurther information: Embryological origins of the mouth and anus\nMain articles: Protostome and Deuterostome\nThe bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many protostomes, the blastopore develops into the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus.\nProtostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage.[147]\nAnimals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily.[148][149] Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm.[150]\nThe main deuterostome phyla are the Echinodermata and the Chordata.[151] Echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.[152] The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones),[153] which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.[154] The deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata (acorn worms).[155][156]\n\nEcdysozoa\nMain article: Ecdysozoa\nEcdysis: a dragonfly has emerged from its dry exuviae and is expanding its wings. Like other arthropods, its body is divided into segments.\nThe Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting.[157] They include the largest animal phylum, the Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water;[158] some are important parasites.[159] Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.[160]\n\nSpiralia\nMain article: Spiralia\nSpiral cleavage in a sea snail embryo\nThe Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo.[161] The Spiralia\'s phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms. All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers.[162][163]\nThe Lophotrochozoa includes the molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, nemerteans, bryozoa and entoprocts.[162][164][165] The molluscs, the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes snails, clams, and squids, while the annelids are the segmented worms, such as earthworms, lugworms, and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share trochophore larvae.[166][167]\n\nHistory of classification\nFurther information: Taxonomy (biology), History of zoology through 1859, and History of zoology since 1859\nJean-Baptiste de Lamarck led the creation of a modern classification of invertebrates, breaking up Linnaeus\'s \"Vermes\" into 9 phyla by 1809.[168]\nIn the classical era, Aristotle divided animals,[e] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch, and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about.[169]\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae.[170] In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espÃ¨ce de chaos (a chaotic mess)[f] and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians.[168]\nIn his 1817 Le RÃ¨gne Animal, Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements (\"branches\" with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms).[172] This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860.[173]\nIn 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges.[174][173] The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia.[175]\n\nIn human culture\nPractical uses\nMain article: Animals in culture\nSides of beef in a slaughterhouse\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species.[176][177] Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially.[176][178][179] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined.[180]\nInvertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food.[181] Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world.[177][182][183] Animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.[184] Dyestuffs including carmine (cochineal),[185][186] shellac,[187][188] and kermes[189][190] have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture.[191]\nAnimals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models.[192][193][194][195] Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century.[196] Some medicines such as the cancer drug trabectedin are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin.[197]\n\nA gun dog retrieving a duck during a hunt\nPeople have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals,[198] and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals,[199] while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish.[200] Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts.[201][202]\nA wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas, octopuses, and praying mantises,[203] reptiles such as snakes and chameleons,[204] and birds including canaries, parakeets, and parrots[205] all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits.[206][207][208] There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.[209]\nA wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.[210]\n\nSymbolic uses\nArtistic vision: Still Life with Lobster and Oysters by Alexander Coosemans, c.â€‰1660\nAnimals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Major animal paintings include Albrecht DÃ¼rer\'s 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs\'s c.â€‰1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.[211] Insects, birds and mammals play roles in literature and film,[212] such as in giant bug movies.[213][214][215]\nAnimals including insects[216] and mammals[217] are featured in mythology and religion. In both Japan and Europe, a butterfly was seen as the personification of a person\'s soul,[216][218][219] while the scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt.[220] Among the mammals, cattle,[221] deer,[217] horses,[222] lions,[223] bats,[224] bears,[225] and wolves[226] are the subjects of myths and worship. The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are also based on animals.[227][228]\n\nSee also\nAnimal coloration\nEthology\nLists of organisms by population\nWorld Animal Day, observed on October 4\nNotes\n\n\n^ Henneguya zschokkei does not have mitochondrial DNA or utilize aerobic respiration.[19]\n\n^ The application of DNA barcoding to taxonomy further complicates this; a 2016 barcoding analysis estimated a total count of nearly 100,000 insect species for Canada alone, and extrapolated that the global insect fauna must be in excess of 10 million species, of which nearly 2 million are in a single fly family known as gall midges (Cecidomyiidae).[75]\n\n^ Not including parasitoids.[71]\n\n^ Compare File:Annelid redone w white background.svg for a more specific and detailed model of a particular phylum with this general body plan.\n\n^ In his History of Animals and Parts of Animals.\n\n^ The French prefix une espÃ¨ce de is pejorative.[171]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ de Queiroz, Kevin; Cantino, Philip; Gauthier, Jacques, eds.

They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.  Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.\nWhile the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda is mostly herbivorous, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varying diets. With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.\nBears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have also been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe English word \"bear\" comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages, such as Swedish björn, also used as a first name. This form is conventionally said to be related to a Proto-Indo-European word for \"brown\", so that \"bear\" would mean \"the brown one\".[1][2] However, Ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible, a word meaning \"brown\" of this form cannot be found in Proto-Indo-European. He suggests instead that \"bear\" is from the Proto-Indo-European word *ǵʰwḗr- ~ *ǵʰwér \"wild animal\".[3] This terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term: proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear—arkto—with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal\'s true name might cause it to appear.[4][5] According to author Ralph Keyes, this is the oldest known euphemism.[6]\nBear taxon names such as Arctoidea and Helarctos come from the ancient Greek ἄρκτος (arktos), meaning bear,[7] as do the names \"arctic\" and \"antarctic\", via the name of the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", prominent in the northern sky.[8]\nBear taxon names such as Ursidae and Ursus come from Latin Ursus/Ursa, he-bear/she-bear.[8] The female first name \"Ursula\", originally derived from a Christian saint\'s name, means \"little she-bear\" (diminutive of Latin ursa). In Switzerland, the male first name \"Urs\" is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of Bern is by legend derived from Bär, German for bear. The Germanic name Bernard (including Bernhardt and similar forms) means \"bear-brave\", \"bear-hardy\", or \"bold bear\".[9][10] The Old English name Beowulf is a kenning, \"bee-wolf\",  for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.[11]\n\nTaxonomy\nFurther information: List of ursids\nThe family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or \"doglike\" carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears\' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids[12] (some scholars formerly argued that bears are directly derived from canids and should not be classified as a separate family).[13] Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, each having 74 chromosomes (see Ursid hybrid), whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.[14]\n\nEvolution\nPlithocyon armagnacensis skull, a member of the extinct subfamily Hemicyoninae from the Miocene\nThe earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today\'s bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.[15] It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene.[16] European genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya),[17] are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.[16] There has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as both groups were semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals.[18][19][20] In addition to the support of the pinniped–amphicynodontine clade, other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being the closest living relatives to pinnipeds.[21][22][23][19][24][20]\n\nLife restoration of Arctotherium bonariense\nThe raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily Hemicyoninae, which first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya.[16] The subfamily includes the younger genera Phoberocyon (20–15 Mya), and Plithocyon (15–7 Mya). A Cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus Ursavus during the early Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of Ursavus subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during the early Miocene (21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15 and 20 Mya,[25][26] likely via the species Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 11 Mya.[27][28]\nThe New World short-faced bears (Tremarctinae) differentiated from Ursinae following a dispersal event into North America during the mid-Miocene (about 13 Mya).[27] They invaded South America (≈2.5 or 1.2 Ma) following formation of the Isthmus of Panama.[29] Their earliest fossil representative is Plionarctos in North America (c. 10–2 Ma). This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the North American short-faced bears (genus Arctodus), the South American short-faced bears (Arctotherium), and the spectacled bears, Tremarctos, represented by both an extinct North American species (T. floridanus), and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American spectacled bear (T. ornatus).[16]\n\nFossil of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), a relative of the brown bear and polar bear from the Pleistocene epoch in Europe\nThe subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today\'s Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear.[27] Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene.[30][31] The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000 years ago.[32]\n\nPhylogeny\nThe relationship of the bear family with other carnivorans is shown in the following phylogenetic tree, which is based on the molecular phylogenetic analysis of six genes in Flynn (2005)[33] with the musteloids updated following the multigene analysis of Law et al. (2018).[34]\n\n\n\n\nCarnivora\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeliformia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Caniformia   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Arctoidea   \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nUrsidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinnipedia \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusteloidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMephitidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiluridae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcyonidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustelidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that although they are called \"bears\" in some languages, red pandas and raccoons and their close relatives are not bears, but rather musteloids.[33]\nThere are two phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships among extant and fossil bear species. One is all species of bears are classified in seven subfamilies as adopted here and related articles: Amphicynodontinae, Hemicyoninae, Ursavinae, Agriotheriinae, Ailuropodinae, Tremarctinae, and Ursinae.[13][35][36][37] Below is a cladogram of the subfamilies of bears after McLellan and Reiner (1992)[13] and Qiu et al.

The latter estimated to have weighed 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) and stood 3.4 m (11 ft 2 in) tall.[45][46] Body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates, as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter.[47]\n\nMorphology\nUnlike most other carnivorans, bears have plantigrade feet. Drawing by Richard Owen, 1866.\nBears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic with regard to size, with males typically being larger.[48][49] Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species.[49] Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the big cats as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, excavate dens, dig out burrowing animals, turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and club large creatures.[47]\n\nDespite being quadrupeds, bears can stand and sit as humans do, as demonstrated by this American black bear.\nUnlike most other land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears\' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.[47]\nMost mammals have agouti hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of color corresponding to two different types of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-colored skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.[47] While bears tend to be uniform in color, some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold black-and-white pelage.[50]\nBears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have color vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.[47]\n\nBrown bear skull\nThe skulls of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscles. The canine teeth are large but mostly used for display, and the molar teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most other members of the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter.[47] Considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species. This may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory.[51] Sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protrusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed.[47] The general dental formula for living bears is: 3.1.2–4.23.1.2–4.3.[47] The structure of the larynx of bears appears to be the most basal of the caniforms.[52] They possess air pouches connected to the pharynx which may amplify their vocalizations.[53]\nBears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum.[54][55] Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[56] Bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.[57]\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe spectacled bear is the only species found in South America.[58]\nFurther information: List of carnivorans by population\nExtant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region.[58] The sun bear\'s range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia.[59] The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.[60]\nThe most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian.[58] They occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear, ice floes.[58][61] Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.[61]\n\nBehavior and ecology\nAmerican black bear tracks at Superior National Forest, Minnesota, U.S.\nBrown and American black bears are generally diurnal, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night.[62] Other species may be nocturnal, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators.[63] Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs).[64][65] Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense.[66] With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use olfaction to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognize their cubs.[47]\n\nFeeding\nGiant panda feeding on bamboo at Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Washington, D. C. This species is almost entirely herbivorous.\nMost bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter, and appears to have evolved from an ancestor which was a low-protein macronutrient omnivore.[67] They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet.[58] At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available.[57] For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.[68]\nWhen foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves.[55][57] Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted.[69] Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behavior.[57] Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage.[69] In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behavior.[70] Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns).[71] Such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources.[72] Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots.[69] The panda\'s diet is over 99% bamboo,[73] of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves.[74][75] Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.[76]\n\nPolar bear feeding on a seal on an ice floe north of Svalbard, Norway. It is the most carnivorous species.\nThe sloth bear is not as specialized as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets.[77] Some individuals become addicted to sweets in garbage inside towns where tourism-related waste is generated throughout the year.[78] Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults.[79] Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey.[80] Fish are an important source of food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.[81][69]\nThe brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly the young and weak.[68][82][81] These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be sniffed out and pounced on.[69][83] The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber.[84][81] Large mammalian prey is typically killed with raw strength, including bites and paw swipes, and bears do not display the specialized killing methods of felids and canids.[85] Predatory behavior in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.[81]\nBears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites, stealing food caches from rodents, and carcasses from other predators.[55][86] For hibernating species, weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy. A brown bear can eat 41 kg (90 lb) of food and gain 2–3 kg (4–7 lb) of fat a day prior to entering its den.[87]\n\nCommunication\nCaptive Asian black bears during an aggressive encounter\nBears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal\'s position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.[52][88][89][90][91][92]\n\nSloth bear rubbing against a tree at Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, India\nBears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright, which exaggerates the individual\'s size. The chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. Staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during agonistic encounters.[50] Individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the canine teeth, muzzle twisting and neck stretching.  A subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.[65][93]\nBears also communicate with their scent and will rub it against trees and other objects.[94] This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post.[95] Pandas establish territories by marking objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands.[96] Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.[97]\n\nReproduction and development\nAmerican black bears mating at the North American Bear Center\nThe mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy.[98][99][100] During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalizing. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.[99]\n\nDuration: 38 seconds.0:38Polar bear mother nursing her cub\nGestation typically lasts 6–9 months, including delayed implantation, and litter size numbers up to four cubs.[101] Giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die.[102] In northern living species, birth takes place during winter dormancy. Cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. By 2–3 months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den. They usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother\'s back.[101][61] Male bears play no role in raising young. Infanticide, where an adult male kills the cubs of another, has been recorded in polar bears, brown bears and American black bears but not in other species.[103] Males kill young to bring the female into estrus.[104] Cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her life.[105][106][107]\nIn some species, offspring may become independent around the next spring, though some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old.[101] Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.[108]\n\nHibernation\nMain article: Hibernation\nBears of northern regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter.[109][110] During hibernation, the bear\'s metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute.[111] Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating.[47] A fecal plug is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring.[112] If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea.[47] Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.[110]\n\nMortality\nHunters with shot bear, Sweden, early 20th century. This photograph is in the Nordic Museum.\nBears do not have many predators. The most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease.[113] Felids like the tiger may also prey on bears,[114][115] particularly cubs, which may also be threatened by canids.[14][100]\nBears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms.[116] By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear\'s life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has been found in polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears.[117] Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus.[118] They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.[119]\n\nRelationship with humans\nConservation\nMain article: Bear conservation\nGiant pandas at the Sichuan Giant Panda SanctuariesA barrel trap in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, used to relocate bears away from where they might attack humans.\nIn modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats[120] and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming.[121] The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable;[122] even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear,[122] are at risk of extirpation in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.[123]\nLaws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance.[124] Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies.[125] The giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, which are home to around 30% of the wild panda population, gained a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation in 2006.[126] Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans.[127][128] In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears, and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.[127]\n\nAttacks\nMain article: Bear attack\nBear warning sign in Alberta, Canada\nSeveral bear species are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. Injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported.[129] Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.[130]\n\nEntertainment, hunting, food and folk medicine\nBears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. They have been trained to dance,[131] and were kept for baiting in Europe from at least the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London, at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived.[132] Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear handlers called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.[133]\nBears have been hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are considered a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.[134][135]\nThe peoples of eastern Asia use bears\' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional Chinese medicine. More than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea for the production of bile. Trade in bear products is prohibited under CITES, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.[136]\n\n\n\n\nThe Dancing Bear by William Frederick Witherington, 1822\n\n\n\nA nomadic ursar, a Romani bear-busker. Drawing by Theodor Aman, 1888\n\n\nCultural depictions\nMain article: Cultural depictions of bears\nSee also: Bear in heraldry\nBears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore and mythology. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female\'s devotion and protection of her cubs.[137] In many Native American cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence.[138] A widespread belief among cultures of North America and northern Asia associated bears with shaman; this may be based on the solitary nature of both. Bears have thus been thought to predict the future and shaman were believed to have been capable of transforming into bears.[139]\nThere is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists.[140] It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and Ainu cultures.[141] The prehistoric Finns,[142] Siberian peoples[143] and more recently Koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers.[144] Artio (Dea Artio in the Gallo-Roman religion) was a Celtic bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at Bern, itself named for the bear. Her name is derived from the Celtic word for \"bear\", artos.[145] In ancient Greece, the archaic cult of Artemis in bear form survived into Classical times at Brauron, where young Athenian girls passed an initiation rite as arktoi \"she bears\".[146]\nThe constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of Ptolemy.[b][8] The nearby star Arcturus means \"guardian of the bear\", as if it were watching the two constellations.[148] Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since Paleolithic times, in the widespread Cosmic Hunt myths. These are found on both sides of the Bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.[149]\nBears are popular in children\'s stories, including Winnie the Pooh,[150] Paddington Bear,[151] Gentle Ben[152] and \"The Brown Bear of Norway\".[153] An early version of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\",[154] was published as \"The Three Bears\" in 1837 by Robert Southey, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by Arthur Rackham.[155] The Hanna-Barbera character Yogi Bear has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films.[156][157] The Care Bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film.[158] Around the world, many children—and some adults—have teddy bears, stuffed toys in the form of bears, named after the American statesman Theodore Roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree.[159]\nBears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onward.[160] Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message \"Only you can prevent forest fires\".[161]\n\n\n\n\n\"The Three Bears\", Arthur Rackham\'s illustration to English Fairy Tales, by Flora Annie Steel, 1918\n\n\n\nThe constellation of Ursa Major as depicted in Urania\'s Mirror, c. 1825\n\n\nOrganizations\nJuvenile pandas at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding\nThe International Association for Bear Research & Management, also known as the International Bear Association, and the Bear Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission, a part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears.

For the record label, see Omnivore Recordings.\n\n\nExamples of omnivores. From left to right: humans,[1] dogs,[2] pigs, channel catfish, American crows, gravel ant\nAmong birds, the hooded crow is a typical omnivore.\nAn omnivore (/ˈɒmnɪvɔːr/) is an animal that has the ability to eat and survive on both plant and animal matter.[3] Obtaining energy and nutrients from plant and animal matter, omnivores digest carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber, and metabolize the nutrients and energy of the sources absorbed.[4] Often, they have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet.[5][6][7]\nOmnivores come from diverse backgrounds that often independently evolved sophisticated consumption capabilities. For instance, dogs evolved from primarily carnivorous organisms (Carnivora) while pigs evolved from primarily herbivorous organisms (Artiodactyla).[8][9][10] Despite this, physical characteristics such as tooth morphology may be reliable indicators of diet in mammals, with such morphological adaptation having been observed in bears.[11][12]\nThe variety of different animals that are classified as omnivores can be placed into further sub-categories depending on their feeding behaviors. Frugivores include cassowaries, orangutans and grey parrots;[13][14][15] insectivores include swallows and pink fairy armadillos;[16][17] granivores include large ground finches and mice.\nAll of these animals are omnivores, yet still fall into special niches in terms of feeding behavior and preferred foods. Being omnivores gives these animals more food security in stressful times or makes possible living in less consistent environments.[18]\n\n\nEtymology and definitions[edit]\nThe word omnivore derives from Latin omnis \'all\' and vora, from vorare \'to eat or devour\', having been coined by the French and later adopted by the English in the 1800s.[19]  Traditionally the definition for omnivory was entirely behavioral by means of simply \"including both animal and vegetable tissue in the diet.[20]\"  In more recent times, with the advent of advanced technological capabilities in fields like gastroenterology, biologists have formulated a standardized variation of omnivore used for labeling a species\' actual ability to obtain energy and nutrients from materials.[21][22]  This has subsequently conditioned two context-specific definitions.\n\nBehavioral:  This definition is used to specify if a species or individual is actively consuming both plant and animal materials.[22][23][24][25] (e.g. \"vegans do not participate in the omnivore based diet.\") In the fields of nutrition, sociology and psychology the terms “omnivore” & “omnivory” is often used to distinguish prototypical highly diverse human diet patterns from restricted diet patterns that exclude major categories of food.[26][27][28][29][30]\nPhysiological:  This definition is often used in academia to specify species that have the capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal matter.[31][page needed][6][21][32] (e.g. \"humans are omnivores due to their capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal materials.\")\nThe taxonomic utility of omnivore\'s traditional and behavioral definition is limited, since the diet, behavior, and phylogeny of one omnivorous species may be very different from that of another: for instance, an omnivorous pig digging for roots and scavenging for fruit and carrion is taxonomically and ecologically quite distinct from an omnivorous chameleon that eats leaves and insects. The term \"omnivory\" is also not always comprehensive because it does not deal with mineral foods such as salt licks or with non-omnivores that self-medicate by consuming either plant or animal material which they otherwise would not (i.e. zoopharmacognosy).\n\nClassification, contradictions and difficulties[edit]\nThough Carnivora is a taxon for species classification, no such equivalent exists for omnivores, as omnivores are widespread across multiple taxonomic clades. The Carnivora order does not include all carnivorous species, and not all species within the Carnivora taxon are carnivorous. (The members of Carnivora are formally referred to as carnivorans.)[33] It is common to find physiological carnivores consuming materials from plants or physiological herbivores  consuming material from animals, e.g. felines eating grass and deer eating birds.[34][35] From a behavioral aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification.  For instance, it is well documented that animals such as giraffes, camels, and cattle will gnaw on bones, preferably dry bones, for particular minerals and nutrients.[36] Felines, which are usually regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestibles (e.g. hair, bones), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.[37]\nOccasionally, it is found that animals historically classified as carnivorous may deliberately eat plant material.  For example, in 2013, it was considered that American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) may be physiologically omnivorous once investigations had been conducted on why they occasionally eat fruits.  It was suggested that alligators probably ate fruits both accidentally and deliberately.[38]\n\"Life-history omnivores\" is a specialized classification given to organisms that change their eating habits during their life cycle.[39]  Some species, such as grazing waterfowl like geese, are known to eat mainly animal tissue at one stage of their lives, but plant matter at another.[40] The same is true for many insects, such as beetles in the family Meloidae,[41] which begin by eating animal tissue as larvae, but change to eating plant matter after they mature. Likewise, many mosquito species in early life eat plants or assorted detritus, but as they mature, males continue to eat plant matter and nectar whereas the females (such as those of Anopheles, Aedes and Culex) also eat blood to reproduce effectively.[42]\n\nOmnivorous species[edit]\nGeneral[edit]\nAlthough cases exist of herbivores eating meat and carnivores eating plant matter, the classification \"omnivore\" refers to the adaptation and main food source of the species in general, so these exceptions do not make either individual animals or the species as a whole omnivorous. For the concept of \"omnivore\" to be regarded as a scientific classification, some clear set of measurable and relevant criteria would need to be considered to differentiate between an \"omnivore\" and other categories, e.g. faunivore, folivore, and scavenger.[43] Some researchers argue that evolution of any species from herbivory to carnivory or carnivory to herbivory would be rare except via an intermediate stage of omnivory.[44]\n\nOmnivorous mammals[edit]\nVarious mammals are omnivorous in the wild, such as species of hominids, pigs,[45] badgers, bears, foxes, coatis, civets, hedgehogs, opossums, skunks, sloths, squirrels,[46] raccoons, chipmunks,[47] mice,[48] hamsters and rats.[49][7][50][51]\n\nMost bear species are omnivores\nMost bear species are omnivores,[52] but individual diets can range from almost exclusively herbivorous (hypocarnivore) to almost exclusively carnivorous (hypercarnivore), depending on what food sources are available locally and seasonally. Polar bears are classified as carnivores, both taxonomically (they are in the order Carnivora), and behaviorally (they subsist on a largely carnivorous diet). Depending on the species of bear, there is generally a preference for one class of food, as plants and animals are digested differently. Canines including wolves, dogs, dingoes, and coyotes eat some plant matter, but they have a general preference and are evolutionarily geared towards meat.[53] However, the maned wolf is a canid whose diet is naturally 50% plant matter.\nLike most arboreal species, squirrels are primarily granivores, subsisting on nuts and seeds.[54] However, like virtually all mammals, squirrels avidly consume some animal food when it becomes available. For example, the American eastern gray squirrel has been introduced to parts of Britain, continental Europe and South Africa. Its effect on populations of nesting birds is often serious because of consumption of eggs and nestlings.[55][56]\n\nOther species[edit]\nVarious birds are omnivorous, with diets varying from berries and nectar to insects, worms, fish, and small rodents. Examples include cranes, cassowaries, chickens, crows[57] and related corvids, kea, rallidae, and rheas. In addition, some lizards (such as Galapagos Lava Lizard), turtles, fish (such as piranhas and catfish), and invertebrates are omnivorous.\nQuite often, mainly herbivorous creatures will eagerly eat small quantities of animal food when it becomes available. Although this is trivial most of the time, omnivorous or herbivorous birds, such as sparrows, often will feed their chicks insects while food is most needed for growth.[58] On close inspection it appears that nectar-feeding birds such as sunbirds rely on the ants and other insects that they find in flowers, not for a richer supply of protein, but for essential nutrients such as cobalt/vitamin b12 that are absent from nectar. Similarly, monkeys of many species eat maggoty fruit, sometimes in clear preference to sound fruit.[59] When to refer to such animals as omnivorous, or otherwise, is a question of context and emphasis, rather than of definition.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nConsumer-resource systems\nEvolution (biology)\nFood chain\nFood energy\nIngestion\nList of diets\nMesocarnivore\nProductivity (ecology)\nList of feeding behaviours\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Beasley, DeAnna; Koltz, Amanda; Lambert, Joanna; Fierer, Noah; Dunn, Rob (29 July 2015). \"The Evolution of Stomach Acidity and Its Relevance to the Human Microbiome\".

As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material.\n\n\n\nChange page preview settings\n\n\n',1),(4,'Owl - Wikipedia','C:\\Users\\daniy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Digital_Content_Retrieval\\level1\\level2\\level3\\Owl - Wikipedia.html','.html',603956,'\nOwl - Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n		Navigation\n	\n\n\nMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n		Contribute\n	\n\n\nHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate account\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\n\n\n\n Create account Log in\n\n\n\n\n\n		Pages for logged out editors learn more\n\n\n\nContributionsTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Donate your 5×1000 to Wikimedia Italia!Write: 94039910156\n                    \n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n            Close\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n(Top)\n\n\n\n\n\n1Anatomy\n\n\n\nToggle Anatomy subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1Sexual dimorphism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2Hunting adaptations\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1Flight and feathers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2Vision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3Hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4Talons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5Beak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6Camouflage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2Behavior\n\n\n\nToggle Behavior subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1Breeding and reproduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3Evolution and systematics\n\n\n\nToggle Evolution and systematics subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1Ogygoptyngidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2Protostrigidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3Sophiornithidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4Tytonidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5Strigidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4Symbolism and mythology\n\n\n\nToggle Symbolism and mythology subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1African cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3Sumerian and ancient Semitic cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4Ancient European and modern Western culture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5Hinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6Native American cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5Rodent control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6Attacks on humans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7Conservation issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9Further reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10External links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle the table of contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwl\n\n\n\n163 languages\n\n\n\n\nAcèhАдыгэбзэAfrikaansአማርኛÆngliscالعربيةܐܪܡܝܐঅসমীয়াAsturianuAtikamekwअवधीAvañe\'ẽAymar aruAzərbaycancaتۆرکجهBasa BaliবাংলাBanjar閩南語 / Bân-lâm-gúБашҡортсаБеларускаяभोजपुरीBikol CentralБългарскиBoarischབོད་ཡིགBrezhonegCatalàЧӑвашлаCebuanoČeštinaChiShonaCymraegDagbanliDanskDeutschDiné bizaadEestiΕλληνικάEspañolEsperantoEuskaraEʋegbeفارسیFøroysktFrançaisFryskGaeilgeGàidhligGalego贛語گیلکی客家語/Hak-kâ-ngî한국어हिन्दीHrvatskiIdoBahasa IndonesiaИронÍslenskaItalianoעבריתJawaಕನ್ನಡქართულიकॉशुर / کٲشُرҚазақшаKernowekKiswahiliКомиKongoKotavaKreyòl ayisyenKurdîКырык марыLatinaLatviešuLëtzebuergeschLietuviųLi NihaLimburgsLingálaLingua Franca NovaLivvinkarjalaMagyarമലയാളംमराठीمصرىمازِرونیBahasa Melayuꯃꯤꯇꯩ ꯂꯣꯟMinangkabau閩東語 / Mìng-dĕ̤ng-ngṳ̄МокшеньМонголမြန်မာဘာသာNederlandsनेपाली日本語NordfriiskNorsk bokmålNorsk nynorskଓଡ଼ିଆOʻzbekcha / ўзбекчаਪੰਜਾਬੀپنجابیپښتوPicardPlattdüütschPolskiPortuguêsRomânăRuna SimiРусиньскыйРусскийСаха тылаSakizayaसंस्कृतम्ᱥᱟᱱᱛᱟᱲᱤScotsSesotho sa LeboaSimple EnglishسنڌيSlovenčinaSlovenščinaŚlůnskiSoomaaligaکوردیСрпски / srpskiSrpskohrvatski / српскохрватскиSundaSuomiSvenskaTagalogதமிழ்TaclḥitTaqbaylitТатарча / tatarçaTayalతెలుగుไทยThuɔŋjäŋТоҷикӣTsetsêhestâheseತುಳುTürkçeTyapУкраїнськаاردوVahcuenghTiếng ViệtWest-VlamsWinarayWolof吴语ייִדישYorùbá粵語ZazakiZeêuwsŽemaitėška中文Tolışi\n\nEdit links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticleTalk\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadView sourceView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n		Actions\n	\n\n\nReadView sourceView history\n\n\n\n\n\n		General\n	\n\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR codeWikidata item\nExpand allEdit interlanguage links\n\n\n\n\n		Print/export\n	\n\n\nDownload as PDFPrintable version\n\n\n\n\n\n		In other projects\n	\n\n\nWikimedia CommonsWikispeciesWikiquote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\nBirds from the order Strigiformes\nFor other uses, see Owl (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\nOwlTemporal range: Late Paleocene to recent 60–0 Ma \nPreꞒ\nꞒ\nO\nS\nD\nC\nP\nT\nJ\nK\nPg\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterclockwise from top left, Strigidae: Tawny owl (Strix aluco), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), Little owl (Athene noctua), Northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus);

Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.\nOwls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family, Tytonidae.[2] Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.\nA group of owls is called a \"parliament\".[3]\n\n\nAnatomy\nBurrowing owl (Athene cunicularia)\nCross-eyed owl\nOwls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls\' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl\'s forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Owls have binocular vision, but they must rotate their entire heads to change the focus of their view because, like most birds, their eyes are fixed in their sockets. Owls are farsighted and cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as \"feelers\". Their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good.\nOwls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270°. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae — humans have only seven — and their vertebral circulatory systems are adapted to allow them to rotate their heads without cutting off blood to the brain. Specifically, the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about 10 times the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery, as is the case in humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird\'s, preventing blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.[4][5]\nThe smallest owl—weighing as little as 31 g (1+3⁄32 oz) and measuring some 13.5 cm (5+1⁄4 in)—is the elf owl (Micrathene whitneyi).[6]  Around the same diminutive length, although slightly heavier, are the lesser known long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi) and Tamaulipas pygmy owl (Glaucidium sanchezi).[6] The largest owls are two similarly sized eagle owls; the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) and Blakiston\'s fish owl (Bubo blakistoni). The largest females of these species are 71 cm (28 in) long, have a 190 cm (75 in) wing span, and weigh 4.2 kg (9+1⁄4 lb).[6][7][8][9][10]\nDifferent species of owls produce different sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species. As noted above, their facial discs help owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears. In many species, these discs are placed asymmetrically, for better directional location.\nOwl plumage is generally cryptic, although several species have facial and head markings, including face masks, ear tufts, and brightly colored irises. These markings are generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats, and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in low-light conditions.[11]\n\nSexual dimorphism\nUSSR stamp, 1979\nSexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. Female owls are typically larger than the males.[12] The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.[12]\nOne theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers. The ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season. In some species, female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest.[13] If food is scarce, the male first feeds himself before feeding the female.[14] Small birds, which are agile, are an important source of food for owls. Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females.[14] Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey.[14] This has also been observed in other predatory birds,[13] which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.[citation needed]\nAnother popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles. In many species, female owls may not leave the nest. Therefore, females may have a larger mass to allow them to go for a longer period of time without starving. For example, one hypothesized sexual role is that larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young, hence female owls are larger than their male counterparts.[12]\nA different theory suggests that the size difference between male and females is due to sexual selection: since large females can choose their mate and may violently reject a male\'s sexual advances, smaller male owls that have the ability to escape unreceptive females are more likely to have been selected.[14]\nIf the character is stable, there can be different optimums for both sexes. Selection operates on both sexes at the same time; therefore it is necessary to explain not only why one of the sexes is relatively bigger, but also why the other sex is smaller.[15] If owls are still evolving toward smaller bodies and longer wing chords, according to V. Geodakyan\'s Evolutionary Theory of Sex, males should be more advanced on these characters. Males are viewed as an evolutionary vanguard of a population, and sexual dimorphism on the character, as an evolutionary \"distance\" between the sexes.  \"Phylogenetic rule of sexual dimorphism\" states that if there exists a sexual dimorphism on any character, then the evolution of this trait goes from the female form toward the male one.[16]\n\nHunting adaptations\nAll owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live on diets of insects, small rodents and lagomorphs. Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish. They are very adept in hunting in their respective environments. Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species.[17]\n\nFlight and feathers\nExternal videos Experiment! How Does An Owl Fly So Silently?, from BBC Earth\nMost owls share an innate ability to fly almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over prey alert to the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow flight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching. Owls\' feathers are generally larger than the average birds\' feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth edges with different rachis structures.[18] Serrated edges along the owl\'s remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a nearly silent mechanism. The serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise.[19] The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2 kHz,[20] making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum of the owl\'s usual prey[20][21] and also within the owl\'s own best hearing range.[22][23] This optimizes the owl\'s ability to silently fly to capture prey without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies, and to hear any noise the prey makes. It also allows the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight pattern.\n\nA great horned owl with wet feathers, waiting out a rainstorm\nThe disadvantage of such feather adaptations for barn owls is that their feathers are not waterproof.[24] The adaptations mean that barn owls do not use the uropygial gland, informally the \"preen\" or \"oil\" gland, as most birds do, to spread oils across their plumage through preening.[25] This makes them highly vulnerable to heavy rain when they are unable to hunt.[26] Historically, they would switch to hunting indoors in wet weather, using barns and other agricultural buildings, but the decline in the numbers of these structures in the 20th and 21st centuries has reduced such opportunities.[24] The lack of waterproofing means that barn owls are also susceptible to drowning, in drinking troughs and other structures with smooth sides. The Barn Owl Trust provides advice on how this can be mitigated, by the installation of floats.[27]\n\nVision\nEyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. Owls are part of a small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes.[28] Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction.[29] Instead of moving their eyes, owls swivel their heads to view their surroundings. Owls\' heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of roughly 270°, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso.[29] This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. Owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimetres of their eyes.[28][30] These mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image.[31] Thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions.[31] These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey.[31]\n\nHearing\nA great horned owl perched on the top of a Joshua tree at evening (twilight) in the Mojave Desert, U.S.\nFurther information: Sound localization in owls\nOwls exhibit specialized hearing functions and ear shapes that also aid in hunting. They are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera. Owls can have either internal or external ears, both of which are asymmetrical. Asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl. Asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey. This is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls Tyto or Tengmalm\'s owl.[29] With ears set at different places on its skull, an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right ears.[32] The owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time, at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound. This time difference between ears is about 30 microseconds.  Behind the ear openings are modified, dense feathers, densely packed to form a facial ruff, which creates an anterior-facing, concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure.[33] This facial ruff is poorly defined in some species, and prominent, nearly encircling the face, in other species. The facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears, and a downward-facing, sharply triangular beak minimizes sound reflection away from the face. The shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively.[29]\nThe prominences above a great horned owl\'s head are commonly mistaken as its ears. This is not the case; they are merely feather tufts. The ears are on the sides of the head in the usual location (in two different locations as described above).\n\nTalons\nWhile the auditory and visual capabilities of the owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey, the talons and beak of the owl do the final work. The owl kills its prey using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body.[29] The crushing power of an owl\'s talons varies according to prey size and type, and by the size of the owl. The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a small, partly insectivorous owl, has a release force of only 5 N. The larger barn owl (Tyto alba) needs a force of 30 N to release its prey, and one of the largest owls, the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) needs a force over 130 N to release prey in its talons.[34] An owl\'s talons, like those of most birds of prey, can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight. The Tasmanian masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey; they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey.[35] An owl\'s claws are sharp and curved. The family Tytonidae has inner and central toes of about equal length, while the family Strigidae has an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one.[34] These different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit.\n\nBeak\nThe beak of the owl is short, curved, and downward-facing, and typically hooked at the tip for gripping and tearing its prey. Once prey is captured, the scissor motion of the top and lower bill is used to tear the tissue and kill. The sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the lower bill to deliver this motion. The downward-facing beak allows the owl\'s field of vision to be clear, as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the face.[36]\n\nCamouflage\nThe snowy owl has effective snow camouflage\nThe coloration of the owl\'s plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible to prey. Owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being an exception. The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly, while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (Strix aluco) allows it to lie in wait among the deciduous woodland it prefers for its habitat. Likewise, the mottled wood-owl (Strix ocellata) displays shades of brown, tan and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes.\n\nBehavior\nComparison of an owl (left) and hawk (right) remex.\nThe serrations on the leading edge of an owl\'s flight feathers reduce noise\nOwl eyes each have nictitating membranes that can move independently of each other, as seen on this spotted eagle-owl in Johannesburg, South Africa.\nMost owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. Several types of owls are crepuscular—active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk; one example is the pygmy owl (Glaucidium). A few owls are active during the day, also; examples are the burrowing owl (Speotyto cunicularia) and the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus).\nMuch of the owls\' hunting strategy depends on stealth and surprise. Owls have at least two adaptations that aid them in achieving stealth. First, the dull coloration of their feathers can render them almost invisible under certain conditions. Secondly, serrated edges on the leading edge of owls\' remiges muffle an owl\'s wing beats, allowing an owl\'s flight to be practically silent. Some fish-eating owls, for which silence has no evolutionary advantage, lack this adaptation.\nAn owl\'s sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole (if it is not too big). Scientists studying the diets of owls are helped by their habit of regurgitating the indigestible parts of their prey (such as bones, scales, and fur) in the form of pellets. These \"owl pellets\" are plentiful and easy to interpret, and are often sold by companies to schools for dissection by students as a lesson in biology and ecology.[37]\n\nBreeding and reproduction\nOwl eggs typically have a white color and an almost spherical shape, and range in number from a few to a dozen, depending on species and the particular season; for most, three or four is the more common number. In at least one species, female owls do not mate with the same male for a lifetime. Female burrowing owls commonly travel and find other mates, while the male stays in his territory and mates with other females.[38]\n\nEvolution and systematics\nA great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) sleeping during daytime in a hollow tree\nRecent phylogenetic studies place owls within the clade Telluraves, most closely related to the Accipitrimorphae and the Coraciimorphae,[39][40] although the exact placement within Telluraves is disputed.[41][42]\nSee below cladogram:\n\n\n\n\nTelluraves\n\n\n\n\n\nAccipitrimorphae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCathartiformes (New World vultures)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccipitriformes (hawks and relatives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrigiformes (owls)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoraciimorphae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColiiformes (mouse birds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCavitaves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeptosomiformes (cuckoo roller)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrogoniformes (trogons and quetzals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicocoraciae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucerotiformes (hornbills and relatives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicodynastornithes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoraciiformes (kingfishers and relatives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiciformes (woodpeckers and relatives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralaves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCariamiformes (seriemas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEufalconimorphae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalconiformes (falcons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsittacopasserae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsittaciformes (parrots)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPasseriformes (passerines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCladogram of Telluraves relationships based on Braun & Kimball (2021)[43]\nSome 220 to 225 extant species of owls are known, subdivided into two families: 1. true owls or typical owls family (Strigidae) and 2. barn-owls family (Tytonidae). Some entirely extinct families have also been erected based on fossil remains; these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized in a very different way (such as the terrestrial Sophiornithidae). The Paleocene genera Berruornis and Ogygoptynx show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 60–57 million years ago (Mya), hence, possibly also some 5 million years earlier, at the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. This makes them one of the oldest known groups of non-Galloanserae landbirds. The supposed \"Cretaceous owls\" Bradycneme and Heptasteornis are apparently non-avialan maniraptors.[44]\nDuring the Paleogene, the Strigiformes radiated into ecological niches now mostly filled by other groups of birds. [clarification needed] The owls as known today, though, evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time, too. By the early Neogene, the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders, leaving only barn owls and typical owls. The latter at that time was usually a fairly generic type of (probably earless) owl similar to today\'s North American spotted owl or the European tawny owl; the diversity in size and ecology found in typical owls today developed only subsequently.\nAround the Paleogene-Neogene boundary (some 25 Mya), barn owls were the dominant group of owls in southern Europe and adjacent Asia at least; the distribution of fossil and present-day owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with the evolution of the different major lineages of true owls, which for the most part seems to have taken place in Eurasia. In the Americas, rather, an expansion of immigrant lineages of ancestral typical owls occurred.\nThe supposed fossil herons \"Ardea\" perplexa (Middle Miocene of Sansan, France) and \"Ardea\" lignitum (Late Pliocene of Germany) were more probably owls; the latter was apparently close to the modern genus Bubo. Judging from this, the Late Miocene remains from France described as \"Ardea\" aureliensis should also be restudied.[45] The Messelasturidae, some of which were initially believed to be basal Strigiformes, are now generally accepted to be diurnal birds of prey showing some convergent evolution toward owls. The taxa often united under Strigogyps[46] were formerly placed in part with the owls, specifically the Sophiornithidae; they appear to be Ameghinornithidae instead.[47][48][49]\n\nThe ancient fossil owl Palaeoglaux artophoron\nFor fossil species and paleosubspecies of extant taxa, see the genus and species articles.

If one saw an owl or heard its hoot, someone was going to die. In general, owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck, ill health, or death. The belief is widespread even today.[55]\n\nAsia\nIn China, owls were traditionally considered to be omens of evil or misfortune.  In Japan, owls are regarded as lucky,[56] although in ancient times they were associated with death.[57] In India, it is associated with bad luck.[58] In Mongolia, the owl is regarded as a benign omen. In one story, Genghis Khan was hiding from enemies in a small coppice when an owl roosted in the tree above him, which caused his pursuers to think no man could be hidden there.[59]\nHootum Pyanchar Naksha by Kaliprasanna Singha (1841–1870), first published in 1861, is a book of social commentaries influential in Bengali literature. The name literally means \"Sketches by a Watching Owl\".\n\nSumerian and ancient Semitic cultures\nIn Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian culture, the owl was associated with Lilith.[60] This association also occurs in the Bible (in some translations) in Isaiah 34:14.[61]\n\nAncient European and modern Western culture\nThe modern West generally associates owls with wisdom and vigilance. This link goes back at least as far as Ancient Greece, where Athens, noted for art and scholarship, and Athena, Athens\' patron goddess and the goddess of wisdom, had the owl as a symbol.[62] Marija Gimbutas traces veneration of the owl as a goddess, among other birds, to the culture of Old Europe, long pre-dating Indo-European cultures.[63]\nT. F. Thiselton-Dyer, in his 1883 Folk-lore of Shakespeare, says that \"from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen,\" and Pliny tells us how, on one occasion, even Rome itself underwent a lustration, because one of them strayed into the Capitol. He represents it also as a funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of humankind. Virgil describes its death howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance introduced as a precursor of Dido\'s death. Ovid, too, constantly speaks of this bird\'s presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets.\"[64] A list of \"omens drear\" in John Keats\' Hyperion includes the \"gloom-bird\'s hated screech.\"[65] Pliny the Elder reports that owls\' eggs were commonly used as a hangover cure.[66]\nOne of the etymologies offered for the name of the German folk hero Till Eulenspiegel is that it means \"Mirror for Owls\".\n\n\n\n\nAn owl-shaped protocorinthian aryballos, c. 640 BCE, from Greece\n\n\n\nA Roman owl mosaic from Italica, Spain\n\n\n\nA Manises plate, c. 1535.

This is the reason why Owls are seen with Lakshmi, who is also the goddess of fortune, wealth, and prosperity.\nAt the same time, owls are also associated with evil times in Hinduism. At times, Chamunda (fearsome form of Chandi) is depicted seated on an owl, her vahana (mount or vehicle). Hindus believe that owls are messengers of death.[68][better source needed]\n\nNative American cultures\nPeople often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children, \"the owls will get you\",[69] and in most Native American folklore, owls are a symbol of death.\nAccording to the Apache and Seminole tribes, hearing owls hooting is considered the subject of numerous \"bogeyman\" stories told to warn children to remain indoors at night or not to cry too much, otherwise the owl may carry them away.[70][71] In some tribal legends, owls are associated with spirits of the dead, and the bony circles around an owl\'s eyes are said to comprise the fingernails of apparitional humans. Sometimes owls are said to carry messages from beyond the grave or deliver supernatural warnings to people who have broken tribal taboos.[72]\nThe Aztecs and the Maya, along with other natives of Mesoamerica, considered the owl a symbol of death and destruction. In fact, the Aztec god of death, Mictlantecuhtli, was often depicted with owls.[73] There is an old saying in Mexico that is still in use:[74] Cuando el tecolote canta, el indio muere (\"When the owl cries/sings, the Indian dies\"). The Popol Vuh, a Mayan religious text, describes owls as messengers of Xibalba (the Mayan \"Place of Fright\").[75]\nThe belief that owls are messengers and harbingers of the dark powers is also found among the Hočągara (Winnebago) of Wisconsin.[76] When in earlier days the Hočągara committed the sin of killing enemies while they were within the sanctuary of the chief\'s lodge, an owl appeared and spoke to them in the voice of a human, saying, \"From now on, the Hočągara will have no luck.\" This marked the beginning of the decline of their tribe.[77] An owl appeared to Glory of the Morning, the only female chief of the Hočąk nation, and uttered her name. Soon after, she died.[78][79]\nAccording to the culture of the Hopi, a Uto-Aztec tribe, taboos surround owls, which are associated with sorcery and other evils.[citation needed]\nThe Ojibwe tribes, as well as their Aboriginal Canadian counterparts, used an owl as a symbol for both evil and death. In addition, they used owls as a symbol of very high status of spiritual leaders of their spirituality.[80]\nThe Pawnee tribes viewed owls as the symbol of protection from any danger within their realms.[80]\nThe Puebloan peoples associated owls with Skeleton Man, the god of death and the spirit of fertility.[80]\nThe Yakama tribes use an owl as a totem, to guide where and how forests and natural resources are useful with management.[80]\n\nRodent control\nA purpose-built owl-house or owlery at a farm near Morton on the Hill, England (2006)\nEncouraging natural predators to control rodent population is a natural form of pest control, along with excluding food sources for rodents. Placing a nest box for owls on a property can help control rodent populations (one family of hungry barn owls can consume more than 3,000 rodents in a nesting season) while maintaining the naturally balanced food chain.[81]\n\nAttacks on humans\nAlthough humans and owls frequently live together in harmony, there have been incidents when owls have attacked humans.[82] For example, in January 2013, a man from Inverness, Scotland suffered heavy bleeding and went into shock after being attacked by an owl, which was likely a 50-centimetre-tall (20 in) eagle-owl.[83] The photographer Eric Hosking lost his left eye after attempting to photograph a tawny owl, which inspired the title of his 1970 autobiography, An Eye for a Bird.\n\nConservation issues\nSee also: List of Strigiformes by population\nThe snowy owl is very endangered in Scandinavia[84] and Finland, where it is found only in northern Lapland.[85]\nAlmost all owls are listed in Appendix II of the international CITES treaty (the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) with four species listed in Appendix I. Although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching may be on the rise. In November 2008, TRAFFIC reported the seizure of 900 plucked and \"oven-ready\" owls in Peninsular Malaysia. Said Chris Shepherd, Senior Programme Officer for TRAFFIC\'s Southeast Asia office, \"This is the first time we know of where \'ready-prepared\' owls have been seized in Malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region. We will be monitoring developments closely.\" TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls. Included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls, spotted wood owls, crested serpent eagles, barred eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.[86]\nIn addition to hunting, other threats to owl populations are habitat loss, pesticides, viruses, and vehicle collisions.[87][88]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Cholewiak, Danielle (2003). \"Strigiformes\".

It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb). It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.\nThe red panda was formally described in 1825. The two currently recognised subspecies, the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda, genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. The red panda\'s place on the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence places it in close affinity with raccoons, weasels, and skunks. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a bear, though both possess elongated wrist bones or \"false thumbs\" used for grasping bamboo. The evolutionary lineage of the red panda (Ailuridae) stretches back around 25 to 18 million years ago, as indicated by extinct fossil relatives found in Eurasia and North America.\nThe red panda inhabits coniferous forests as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, favouring steep slopes with dense bamboo cover close to water sources. It is solitary and largely arboreal. It feeds mainly on bamboo shoots and leaves, but also on fruits and blossoms. Red pandas mate in early spring, with the females giving birth to litters of up to four cubs in summer. It is threatened by poaching as well as destruction and fragmentation of habitat due to deforestation. The species has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2015. It is protected in all range countries.\nCommunity-based conservation programmes have been initiated in Nepal, Bhutan and northeastern India; in China, it benefits from nature conservation projects. Regional captive breeding programmes for the red panda have been established in zoos around the world. It is featured in animated movies, video games, comic books and as the namesake of companies and music bands.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the name panda is uncertain, but one of the most likely theories is that it derived from the Nepali word \"ponya\".[3] The word पञ्जा pajā or पौँजा pañjā means \"ball of the foot\" and \"claws\".[4] The Nepali words \"nigalya ponya\" has been translated as \"bamboo footed\" and is thought to be the red panda\'s Nepali name; in English, it was simply called panda, and was the only animal known under this name for more than 40 years; it became known as the red panda or lesser panda to distinguish it from the giant panda, which was formally described and named in 1869.[3]\nThe genus name Ailurus is adopted from the Ancient Greek word αἴλουρος ailouros meaning \'cat\'.[5] The specific epithet fulgens is Latin for \'shining, bright\'.[3][6]\n\nTaxonomy\nWatercolour painting of a red panda commissioned by Thomas Hardwicke c. 1820[7]\nThe red panda was described and named in 1825 by Frederic Cuvier, who gave it its current scientific name Ailurus fulgens. Cuvier\'s description was based on zoological specimens, including skin, paws, jawbones and teeth \"from the mountains north of India\", as well as an account by Alfred Duvaucel.[8][9] The red panda was described earlier by Thomas Hardwicke in 1821, but his paper was only published in 1827.[3][10] In 1902, Oldfield Thomas described a skull of a male red panda specimen under the name Ailurus fulgens styani in honour of Frederick William Styan who had collected this specimen in Sichuan.[2]\n\nSubspecies and species\nThe modern red panda is the only recognised species in the genus Ailurus. It is traditionally divided into two subspecies: the Himalayan red panda (A. f. fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (A. f. styani). The Himalayan subspecies has a straighter profile, a lighter coloured forehead and ochre-tipped hairs on the lower back and rump. The Chinese subspecies has a more curved forehead and sloping snout, a darker coat with a less white face and more contrast between the tail rings.[11]\nIn 2020, results of a genetic analysis of red panda samples showed that the red panda populations in the Himalayas and China were separated about 250,000 years ago. The researchers suggested that the two subspecies should be treated as distinct species. Red pandas in southeastern Tibet and northern Myanmar were found to be part of styani, while those of southern Tibet were of fulgens in the strict sense.[12] DNA sequencing of 132 red panda faecal samples collected in Northeast India and China also showed two distinct clusters indicating that the Siang River constitutes the boundary between the Himalayan and Chinese red pandas.[13] They probably diverged due to glaciation events on the southern Tibetan Plateau in the Pleistocene.[14]\n\nPhylogeny\nThe placement of the red panda on the evolutionary tree has been debated. In the early 20th century, various scientists placed it in the family Procyonidae with raccoons and their allies. At the time, most prominent biologists also considered the red panda to be related to the giant panda, which would eventually be found to be a bear. A 1982 study examined the similarities and differences in the skull between the red panda and the giant panda, other bears and procyonids, and placed the species in its own family Ailuridae. The author of the study considered the red panda to be more closely related to bears.[11] A 1995 mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed that the red panda has close affinities with procyonids.[15] Further genetic studies in 2005, 2018 and 2021 have placed the red panda within the clade Musteloidea, which also includes Procyonidae, Mustelidae (weasels and relatives) and Mephitidae (skunks and relatives).[16][17][18]\n\nPhylogenetic relationship of the red panda based on analysis ofSix genes from 76 Carnivora species[16]\n\n\n\nCaniformia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArctoidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrsidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinnipedia \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusteloidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiluridae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMephitidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcyonidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustelidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46 genes from 75 musteloid species[17]\n\n\n\nMusteloidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMephitidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiluridae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcyonidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustelidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitogenomes from 220 mammal species[18]\n\n\n\nCaniformia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArctoidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrsidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinnipedia \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusteloidea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiluridae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMephitidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcyonidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustelidae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFossil record\nReconstructed skull and head of Simocyon, a large carnivorous early relative of the modern red panda\nThe family Ailuridae appears to have evolved in Europe in either the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene, about 25 to 18 million years ago. The earliest member Amphictis is known from its 10 cm (4 in) skull and may have been around the same size as the modern species. Its dentition consists of sharp premolars and carnassials (P4 and m1) and molars adapted for grinding (M1, M2 and m2), suggesting that it had a generalised carnivorous diet. Its placement within Ailuridae is based on the grooves on the side of its canine teeth. Other early or basal ailurids include Alopecocyon and Simocyon, whose fossils have been found throughout Eurasia and North America dating from the Middle Miocene, the latter of which survived into the Early Pliocene.  Both have similar teeth to Amphictis and thus had a similar diet.[19] The puma-sized Simocyon was likely a tree-climber and shared a \"false thumb\"—an extended wrist bone—with the modern species, suggesting the appendage was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion and not to feed on bamboo.[19][20]\nLater and more advanced ailurids are classified in the subfamily Ailurinae and are known as the \"true\" red pandas. These animals were smaller and more adapted for an omnivorous or herbivorous diet. The earliest known true panda is Magerictis from the Middle Miocene of Spain and known only from one tooth, a lower second molar. The tooth shows both ancestral and new characteristics having a relatively low and simple crown but also a lengthened crushing surface with developed tooth cusps like later species.[21] Later ailurines include Pristinailurus bristoli which lived in eastern North America from the late Miocene to the Early Pliocene[21][22] and species of the genus Parailurus which first appear in Early Pliocene Europe, spreading across Eurasia into North America.[21][23] These animals are classified as a sister taxon to the lineage of the modern red panda. In contrast to the herbivorous modern species, these ancient pandas were likely omnivores, with highly cusped molars and sharp premolars.[21][22][24]\nThe earliest fossil record of the modern genus Ailurus dates no earlier than the Pleistocene and appears to have been limited to Asia. The modern red panda\'s lineage became adapted for a specialised bamboo diet, having molar-like premolars and more elevated cusps.[21] The false thumb would secondarily gain a function in feeding.[19][20]\n\nGenomics\nAnalysis of 53 red panda samples from Sichuan and Yunnan showed a high level of genetic diversity.[25] The full genome of the red panda was sequenced in 2017. Researchers have compared it to the genome of the giant panda to learn the genetics of convergent evolution, as both species have false thumbs and are adapted for a specialised bamboo diet despite having the digestive system of a carnivore. Both pandas show modifications to certain limb development genes (DYNC2H1 and PCNT), which may play roles in the development of the thumbs.[26] In switching from a carnivorous to a herbivorous diet, both species have reactivated taste receptor genes used for detecting bitterness, though the specific genes are different.[27]\n\nDescription\nRed panda skullRed panda face\nThe red panda\'s coat is mainly red or orange-brown with a black belly and legs. The muzzle, cheeks, brows and inner ear margins are mostly white while the bushy tail has red and buff ring patterns and a dark brown tip.[28][29][30] The colouration appears to serve as camouflage in habitat with red moss and white lichen-covered trees. The guard hairs are longer and rougher while the dense undercoat is fluffier with shorter hairs.[29] The guard hairs on the back have a circular cross-section and are 47–56 mm (1.9–2.2 in) long. It has moderately long whiskers around the mouth, lower jaw and chin. The hair on the soles of the paws allows the animal to walk in snow.[28]\nThe red panda has a relatively small head, though proportionally larger than in similarly sized raccoons, with a reduced snout and triangular ears, and nearly evenly lengthed limbs.[28][29] It has a head-body length of 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail. The Himalayan red panda is recorded to weigh 3.2–9.4 kg (7.1–20.7 lb), while the Chinese red panda weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb) for females and 4.2–13.4 kg (9.3–29.5 lb) for males.[28] It has five curved digits on each foot, each with curved semi-retractile claws that aid in climbing.[29] The pelvis and hindlimbs have flexible joints, adaptations for an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle.[31] While not prehensile, the tail helps the animal balance while climbing.[29]\nThe forepaws possess a \"false thumb\", which is an extension of a wrist bone, the radial sesamoid found in many carnivorans. This thumb allows the animal to grip onto bamboo stalks and both the digits and wrist bones are highly flexible. The red panda shares this feature with the giant panda, which has a larger sesamoid that is more compressed at the sides. In addition, the red panda\'s sesamoid has a more sunken tip while the giant panda\'s curves in the middle. These features give the giant panda more developed dexterity.[32]\nThe red panda\'s skull is wide, and its lower jaw is robust.[28][29] However, because it eats leaves and stems, which are not as tough, it has smaller chewing muscles than the giant panda. The digestive system of the red panda is only 4.2 times its body length, with a simple stomach, no noticeable divide between the ileum and colon, and no caecum.[28]\nBoth sexes have paired anal glands that emit a secretion consisting of long-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, squalene and 2-Piperidinone; the latter is the most odoriferous compound and is perceived by humans as having an ammoniacal or pepper-like odour.[33]\n\nDistribution and habitat\nRed panda in Neora Valley National Park\nThe red panda inhabits Nepal, the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh in India, Bhutan, southern Tibet, northern Myanmar and China\'s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.[1] The global potential habitat of the red panda has been estimated to comprise 47,100 km2 (18,200 sq mi) at most; this habitat is located in the temperate climate zone of the Himalayas with a mean annual temperature range of 18–24 °C (64–75 °F).[34] Throughout this range, it has been recorded at elevations of 2,000–4,300 m (6,600–14,100 ft).[35][36][37][38][39]\n\n\nHabitat of the red panda\nhide\n\nCountry\n\nEstimated size[34]\n\n\nNepal\n22,400 km2 (8,600 sq mi)\n\n\nChina\n13,100 km2 (5,100 sq mi)\n\n\nIndia\n5,700 km2 (2,200 sq mi)\n\n\nMyanmar\n5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi)\n\n\nBhutan\n900 km2 (350 sq mi)\n\n\nTotal\n47,100 km2 (18,200 sq mi)\n\nIn Nepal, it lives in six protected area complexes within the Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests ecoregion.[37] The westernmost records to date were obtained in three community forests in Kalikot District in 2019.[40] Panchthar and Ilam Districts represent its easternmost range in the country, where its habitat in forest patches is surrounded by villages, livestock pastures and roads.[41] The metapopulation in protected areas and wildlife corridors in the Kangchenjunga landscape of Sikkim and northern West Bengal is partly connected through old-growth forests outside protected areas.[42] Forests in this landscape are dominated by Himalayan oaks (Quercus lamellosa and Q. semecarpifolia), Himalayan birch, Himalayan fir, Himalayan maple with bamboo, Rhododendron and some black juniper shrub growing in the understoreys.[35][43][44][45] Records in Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh\'s Pangchen Valley, West Kameng and Shi Yomi districts indicate that it frequents habitats with Yushania and Thamnocalamus bamboo, medium-sized Rhododendron, whitebeam and chinquapin trees.[36][46][47] In China, it inhabits the Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests and Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests in the Hengduan, Qionglai, Xiaoxiang, Daxiangling and Liangshan Mountains in Sichuan.[38] In the adjacent Yunnan province, it was recorded only in the northwestern montane part.[48][49]\nThe red panda prefers microhabitats within 70–240 m (230–790 ft) of water sources.[50][51][52][53] Fallen logs and tree stumps are important habitat features, as they facilitate access to bamboo leaves.[54] Red pandas have been recorded to use steep slopes of more than 20° and stumps exceeding a diameter of 30 cm (12 in).[50][52] Red pandas observed in Phrumsengla National Park used foremost easterly and southerly slopes with a mean slope of 34° and a canopy cover of 66 per cent that were overgrown with bamboo about 23 m (75 ft) in height.[51] In Dafengding Nature Reserve, it prefers steep south-facing slopes in winter and inhabits forests with bamboo 1.5–2.5 m (4 ft 11 in – 8 ft 2 in) tall.[55] In Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve, it inhabits mixed coniferous forest with a dense canopy cover of more than 75 per cent, steep slopes and a density of at least 70 bamboo plants/m2 (6.5 bamboo plants/sq ft).[56] In some parts of China, the red panda coexists with the giant panda. In Fengtongzhai and Yele National Nature Reserves, red panda microhabitat is characterised by steep slopes with lots of bamboo stems, shrubs, fallen logs and stumps, whereas the giant panda prefers gentler slopes with taller but lesser amounts of bamboo and less habitat features overall. Such niche separation lessens competition between the two bamboo-eating species.[50][54]\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nRed panda sleeping on a tree\nThe red panda is difficult to observe in the wild,[57] and most studies on its behaviour have taken place in captivity.[58] The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, sleeping in between periods of activity at night. It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other elevated spaces, stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. It is adapted for climbing and descends to the ground head-first with the hindfeet holding on to the middle of the tree trunk. It moves quickly on the ground by trotting or bounding.[29]\n\nSocial spacing\nAdult pandas are generally solitary and territorial. Individuals mark their home range or territorial boundaries with urine, faeces and secretions from the anal and surrounding glands. Scent-marking is usually done on the ground, with males marking more often and for longer periods.[29] In China\'s Wolong National Nature Reserve, the home range of a radio-collared female was 0.94 km2 (0.36 sq mi), while that of a male was 1.11 km2 (0.43 sq mi).[59] A one-year-long monitoring study of ten red pandas in eastern Nepal showed that the four males had median home ranges of 1.73 km2 (0.67 sq mi) and the six females of 0.94 km2 (0.36 sq mi) within a forest cover of at least 19.2 ha (47 acres). The females travelled 419–841 m (1,375–2,759 ft) per day and the males 660–1,473 m (2,165–4,833 ft). In the mating season from January to March, adults travelled a mean of 795 m (2,608 ft) and subadults a mean of 861 m (2,825 ft).[41] They all had larger home ranges in areas with low forest cover and reduced their activity in areas that were disturbed by people, livestock and dogs.[60]\n\nDiet and feeding\nThe red panda is largely herbivorous and feeds primarily on bamboo, mainly the genera Phyllostachys, Sinarundinaria, Thamnocalamus and Chimonobambusa.[61] It also feeds on fruits, blossoms, acorns, eggs, birds and small mammals. Bamboo leaves may be the most abundant food item year-round and the only food they can access during winter.[62] In Wolong National Nature Reserve, leaves of the bamboo species Bashania fangiana were found in nearly 94 per cent of analysed droppings, and its shoots were found in 59 per cent of the droppings found in June.[59]\nThe diet of red pandas monitored at three sites in Singalila National Park for two years consisted of 40–83 per cent Yushania maling and 51–91.2 per cent Thamnocalamus spathiflorus bamboos[a] supplemented by bamboo shoots, Actinidia strigosa fruits and seasonal berries.[65] In this national park, red panda droppings also contained remains of silky rose and bramble fruit species in the summer season, Actinidia callosa in the post-monsoon season, and Merrilliopanax alpinus, the whitebeam species Sorbus cuspidata and tree rhododendron in both seasons. Droppings were found with 23 plant species including the stone oak species Lithocarpus pachyphyllus, Campbell\'s magnolia, the chinquapin species Castanopsis tribuloides, Himalayan birch, Litsea sericea and the holly species Ilex fragilis.[66] In Nepal\'s Rara National Park, Thamnocalamus was found in all the droppings sampled, both before and after the monsoon.[67] Its summer diet in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve also includes some lichens and barberries.[43] In Bhutan\'s Jigme Dorji National Park, red panda faeces found in the fruiting season contained seeds of Himalayan ivy.[53]\n\nRed panda feeding\nThe red panda grabs food with one of its front paws and usually eats sitting down or standing. When foraging for bamboo, it grabs the plant by the stem and pulls it down towards its jaws. It bites the leaves with the side of the cheek teeth and then shears, chews and swallows. Smaller food like blossoms, berries and small leaves are eaten differently, being clipped by the incisors.[29] Having the gastrointestinal tract of a carnivore, the red panda cannot properly digest bamboo, which passes through its gut in two to four hours. Hence, it must consume large amounts of the most nutritious plant matter. It eats over 1.5 kg (3 lb 5 oz) of fresh leaves or 4 kg (9 lb) of fresh shoots in a day with crude proteins and fats being the most easily digested. Digestion is highest in summer and fall but lowest in winter, and is easier for shoots than leaves.[68] The red panda\'s metabolic rate is comparable to other mammals of its size, despite its poor diet.[69] The red panda digests almost a third of dry matter, which is more efficient than the giant panda digesting 17 per cent.[68] Microbes in the gut may aid in its processing of bamboo; the microbiota community in the red panda is less diverse than in other mammals.[70]\n\nCommunication\nDuration: 8 seconds.0:08Sounds of red panda twittering\nAt least seven different vocalisations have been recorded from the red panda, comprising growls, barks, squeals, hoots, bleats, grunts and twitters. Growling, barking, grunting and squealing are produced during fights and aggressive chasing. Hooting is made in response to being approached by another individual. Bleating is associated with scent-marking and sniffing. Males may bleat during mating, while females twitter.[71] During both play fighting and aggressive fighting, individuals curve their backs and tails while slowly moving their heads up and down. They then turn their heads while jaw-clapping, move their heads laterally and lift a forepaw to strike. They stand on their hind legs, raise the forelimbs above the head and then pounce. Two red pandas may \"stare\" at each other from a distance.[29]\n\nReproduction and parenting\nRed panda tending its cub\nRed pandas are long-day breeders, reproducing after the winter solstice as daylight grows longer. Mating thus takes place from January to March, with births occurring from May to August. Reproduction is delayed by six months for captive pandas in the southern hemisphere. Oestrous lasts a day, and females can enter oestrous multiple times a season, but it is not known how long the intervals between each cycle last.[72]\nAs the reproductive season begins, males and females interact more, and will rest, move, and feed near each other. An oestrous female will spend more time marking and males will inspect her anogenital region. Receptive females make tail-flicks and position themselves in a lordosis pose, with the front lowered to the ground and the spine curved. Copulation involves the male mounting the female from behind and on top, though face-to-face matings as well as belly-to-back matings while lying on the sides also occur. The male will grab the female by the sides with his front paws instead of biting her neck. Intromission is 2–25 minutes long, and the couple groom each other between each bout.[72]\nGestation lasts about 131 days.[73] Prior to giving birth, the female selects a denning site, such as a tree, log or stump hollow or rock crevice, and builds a nest using material from nearby, such as twigs, sticks, branches, bark bits, leaves, grass and moss.[57] Litters typically consist of one to four cubs that are born fully furred but blind. They are entirely dependent on their mother for the first three to four months until they first leave the nest. They nurse for their first five months.[73] The bond between mother and offspring lasts until the next mating season. Cubs are fully grown at around 12 months and at around 18 months they reach sexual maturity.[29] Two radio-collared cubs in eastern Nepal separated from their mothers at the age of 7–8 months and left their birth areas three weeks later. They reached new home ranges within 26–42 days and became residents after exploring them for 42–44 days.[41]\n\nMortality and diseases\nThe red panda\'s lifespan in captivity reaches 14 years.[29] They have been recorded falling prey to leopards in the wild.[74] Faecal samples of red panda collected in Nepal contained parasitic protozoa, amoebozoans, roundworms, trematodes and tapeworms.[75][76] Roundworms, tapeworms and coccidia were also found in red panda scat collected in Rara and Langtang National Parks.[77] Fourteen red pandas at the Knoxville Zoo suffered from severe ringworm, so the tails of two were amputated.[78] Chagas disease was reported as the cause of death of a red panda kept in a Kansas zoo.[79] Amdoparvovirus was detected in the scat of six red pandas in the Sacramento Zoo.[80] Eight captive red pandas in a Chinese zoo suffered from shortness of breath and fever shortly before they died of pneumonia; autopsy revealed that they had antibodies to the protozoans Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis species indicating that they were intermediate hosts.[81] A captive red panda in the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding died of unknown reasons; an autopsy showed that its kidneys, liver and lungs were damaged by a bacterial infection caused by Escherichia coli.[82]\n\nThreats\nThe red panda is primarily threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat, the causes of which include increasing human population, deforestation, the unlawful taking of non-wood forest material and disturbances by herders and livestock.[1] Trampling by livestock inhibits bamboo growth,[74] and clearcutting decreases the ability of some bamboo species to regenerate.[83] The cut lumber stock in Sichuan alone reached 2,661,000 m3 (94,000,000 cu ft) in 1958–1960, and around 3,597.9 km2 (1,389.2 sq mi) of red panda habitat were logged between the mid-1970s and late 1990s.[48] Throughout Nepal, the red panda habitat outside protected areas is negatively affected by solid waste, livestock trails and herding stations, and people collecting firewood and medicinal plants.[43][84] Threats identified in Nepal\'s Lamjung District include grazing by livestock during seasonal transhumance, human-made forest fires and the collection of bamboo as cattle fodder in winter.[85] Vehicular traffic is a significant barrier to red panda movement between habitat patches.[60]\nPoaching is also a major threat.[1] In Nepal, 121 red panda skins were confiscated between 2008 and 2018. Traps meant for other wildlife have been recorded killing red pandas.[86] In Myanmar, the red panda is threatened by hunting using guns and traps; since roads to the border with China were built starting in the early 2000s, red panda skins and live animals have been traded and smuggled across the border.[39] In southwestern China, the red panda is hunted for its fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. The red panda population in China has been reported to have decreased by 40 per cent over the last 50 years, and the population in western Himalayan areas are considered to be smaller.[48] Between 2005 and 2017, 35 live and seven dead red pandas were confiscated in Sichuan, and several traders were sentenced to 3–12 years of imprisonment. A month-long survey of 65 shops in nine Chinese counties in the spring of 2017 revealed only one in Yunnan offered hats made of red panda skins, and red panda tails were offered in an online forum.[87]\n\nConservation\nThe red panda is listed in CITES Appendix I and protected in all range countries; hunting is illegal. It has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend. A large extent of its habitat is part of protected areas.[1]\n\n\nProtected areas in red panda range countries\nhide\n\nCountry\n\nProtected areas\n\n\nNepal\nApi Nampa Conservation Area, Khaptad National Park, Rara National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Manaslu Conservation Area, Langtang National Park, Gaurishankar Conservation Area, Sagarmatha National Park, Makalu Barun National Park, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area[37]\n\n\nIndia\nKhangchendzonga National Park, Singalila National Park, Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary, Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary,[42] Namdapha National Park[88]\n\n\nBhutan\nJigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve, Jigme Dorji National Park, Wangchuck Centennial National Park, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary, Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, Phrumsengla National Park, Jomotsangkha Wildlife Sanctuary[36]\n\n\nMyanmar\nHkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary,[89] Imawbum National Park[39]\n\n\nChina\nYarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon Nature Reserve in Tibet,[90] Wolong National Nature Reserve, Fengtongzhai and Yele National Nature Reserves, Dafengding Nature Reserve and Giant Panda National Park in Sichuan,[59][50][54][55][38] Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve in Yunnan[56]\n\n\nClose-up of a red panda\nA red panda anti-poaching unit and community-based monitoring have been established in Langtang National Park. Members of Community Forest User Groups also protect and monitor red panda habitats in other parts of Nepal.[91] Community outreach programs have been initiated in eastern Nepal using information boards, radio broadcasting and the annual International Red Panda Day in September; several schools endorsed a red panda conservation manual as part of their curricula.[92]\nSince 2010, community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in 10 districts in Nepal that aim to help villagers reduce their dependence on natural resources through improved herding and food processing practices and alternative income possibilities. The Nepali government ratified a five-year Red Panda Conservation Action Plan in 2019.[93] From 2016 to 2019, 35 ha (86 acres) of high-elevation rangeland in Merak, Bhutan, was restored and fenced in cooperation with 120 herder families to protect the red panda forest habitat and improve communal land.[94] Villagers in Arunachal Pradesh established two community conservation areas to protect the red panda habitat from disturbance and exploitation of forest resources.[46] China has initiated several projects to protect its environment and wildlife, including Grain for Green, The Natural Forest Protection Project and the National Wildlife/Natural Reserve Construction Project. For the last project, the red panda is not listed as a key species for protection but may benefit from the protection of the giant panda and golden snub-nosed monkey, with which it overlaps in range.[95]\n\nIn captivity\nRed panda at Symbio Wildlife Park\nThe London Zoo received two red pandas in 1869 and 1876, the first of which was caught in Darjeeling. The Calcutta Zoo received a live red panda in 1877, the Philadelphia Zoo in 1906, and Artis and Cologne Zoos in 1908. In 1908, the first captive red panda cubs were born in an Indian zoo. In 1940, the San Diego Zoo imported four red pandas from India that had been caught in Nepal; their first litter was born in 1941. Cubs that were born later were sent to other zoos; by 1969, about 250 red pandas had been exhibited in zoos.[96] The Taronga Conservation Society started keeping red pandas in 1977.[97]\nIn 1978, a breed registry, the International Red Panda Studbook, was set up, followed by the Red Panda European Endangered Species Programme in 1985. Members of international zoos ratified a global master plan for the captive breeding of the red panda in 1993. By late 2015, 219 red pandas lived in 42 zoos in Japan.[98] The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park participates in the Red Panda Species Survival Plan and kept about 25 red pandas by 2016.[99] By the end of 2019, 182 European zoos kept 407 red pandas.[100] Regional captive breeding programmes have also been established in North American, Australasian and South African zoos.[3]\n\nCultural significance\nRed panda on a 2009 stamp from India\nThe red panda\'s role in the culture and folklore of local people is limited. A drawing of a red panda exists on a 13th-century Chinese scroll.[101] In Nepal\'s Taplejung District, red panda claws are used for treating epilepsy; its skin is used in rituals for treating sick people, making hats, scarecrows and decorating houses.[86] In western Nepal, Magar shamans use its skin and fur in their ritual dresses and believe that it protects against evil spirits. People in central Bhutan consider red pandas to be reincarnations of Buddhist monks. Some tribal people in northeast India and the Yi people believe that it brings good luck to wear red panda tails or hats made of its fur.[101] In China, the fur is used for local cultural ceremonies. At weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. Hats made of red panda tails are also used by local newlyweds as a \"good-luck charm\".[48]\nThe red panda was recognised as the state animal of Sikkim in the early 1990s and was the mascot of the Darjeeling Tea Festival.[83] It has been featured on stamps and coins issued by several red panda range states. Anthropomorphic red pandas feature in animated movies and TV series such as The White Snake Enchantress, Bamboo Bears, Barbie as the Island Princess, DreamWork\'s Kung Fu Panda franchise, Aggretsuko and Disney/Pixar\'s Turning Red, and in several video games and comic books. It is the namesake of the Firefox browser and has been used as the namesake of music bands and of companies. Its appearance has been used for plush toys, t-shirts, postcards and other items.[101]\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c d e f Glatston, A.; Wei, F.; Than Zaw & Sherpa, A.

The vertebrates consist of all the taxa within the subphylum Vertebrata (/ˌvɜːrtəˈbreɪtə/)[4] (chordates with backbones) and represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 69,963 species described.[5]\nVertebrates comprise groups such as the following infraphyla and classes:\n\nAgnatha or jawless fish, which include:\n†Conodonta\n†Ostracodermi\nCyclostomi (hagfish and lampreys)\nGnathostomata or jawed vertebrates, which include:\n†Placodermi\n†Acanthodii\nChondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish, (sharks, rays and ratfish)\nOsteichthyes or bony fish, which include:\nActinopterygii or ray-finned fish, which comprises the majority of living bony fish and over half of all living vertebrates, including:\nCladistia (bichirs and relatives)\nChondrostei (sturgeons and paddlefish)\nHolostei (bowfins and gars)\nTeleostei (96% of living fish species)\nSarcopterygii or lobe-finned fish, which include:\nActinistia (coelacanths)\nDipnomorpha (lungfish)\nTetrapoda[a] or limbed vertebrates\nAmphibians (lissamphibians, as well as the extinct temnospondyls and lepospondyls)\nAmniotes or true land vertebrates\nSauropsids (reptiles and birds, as well as the extinct parareptiles, dinosaurs, pterosaurs and Mesozoic marine reptiles)\nSynapsids (mammals as well as all their extinct relatives and pelycosaurid/therapsid ancestors)\nExtant vertebrates vary in body lengths ranging from the frog species Paedophryne amauensis, at as little as 7.7 mm (0.30 in), to the blue whale, at up to 33 m (108 ft). Vertebrates make up less than five percent of all described animal species; the rest are described as invertebrates, an informal polyphyletic group comprising all that lack vertebral columns, which include non-vertebrate chordates such as lancelets.\nThe vertebrates traditionally include the hagfish, which do not have proper vertebrae due to their loss in evolution,[7] though their closest living relatives, the lampreys, do.[8] Hagfish do, however, possess a cranium. For this reason, the vertebrate subphylum is sometimes referred to as Craniata or \"craniates\" when discussing morphology. Molecular analysis since 1992 has suggested that hagfish are most closely related to lampreys,[9] and so also are vertebrates in a monophyletic sense. Others consider them a sister group of vertebrates in the common taxon of Craniata.[10]\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe word vertebrate derives from the Latin word vertebratus (Pliny), meaning joint of the spine.[11] A similarly derived word is vertebra, which refers to any of the irregular bones or segments of the spinal column.[12]\n\nAnatomy and morphology[edit]\nAll vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a rigid axial endoskeleton (vertebral column and/or notochord) running along the length of the animal,[13] dorsal to the gut tube, with a hollow dorsal nerve cord (the neural tube, which develops into the brain and spinal cord) running more dorsal to it. The endoskeleton continues beyond the anus and often forms an elongated tail (post-anal tail).[14] All vertebrates also possess pharyngeal arches, as well as an iodine-concentrating organ called the endostyle, which develops into the thyroid in adults.\n\nVertebral column[edit]\nFossilized skeleton (cast) of Diplodocus carnegii, showing an extreme example of the backbone that characterizes the vertebrates.\nWith only one exception, the defining characteristic of all vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the embryonic notochord found in all chordates is replaced by a segmented series of mineralized elements called vertebrae separated by fibrocartilaginous intervertebral discs, which are derived embryonically and evolutionarily from the notochord. Hagfish are the only extant vertebrate whose notochord persists and is not integrated/ replaced by the vertebral column.\nA few vertebrates have secondarily lost this feature and retain the notochord into adulthood, such as the sturgeon[15] and coelacanth. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages (fins or limbs, which may be secondarily lost), but this trait is not required to qualify an animal as a vertebrate.\n\nGills[edit]\nGill arches bearing gills in a pike\nAll basal vertebrates are aquatic and breathe with gills. The gills are carried right behind the head, bordering the posterior margins of a series of openings from the pharynx to the exterior. Each gill is supported by a cartilaginous or bony gill arch.[16] The bony fish have three pairs of arches, cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs, while the primitive jawless fish have seven. The vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches than this, as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills.[14] In jawed vertebrates, the first gill arch pair evolved into the jointed jaws and form an additional oral cavity ahead of the pharynx. Research also suggests that the sixth branchial arch contributed to the formation of the vertebrate shoulder, which separated the head from the body.[17]\nIn amphibians and some primitive bony fishes, the larvae bear external gills, branching off from the gill arches.[18] These are reduced in adulthood, their function taken over by the gills proper in fishes and by lungs in most amphibians. Some amphibians retain the external larval gills in adulthood, the complex internal gill system as seen in fish apparently being irrevocably lost very early in the evolution of tetrapods.[19]\nWhile the more derived vertebrates lack gills, the gill arches form during fetal development, and form the basis of essential structures such as jaws, the thyroid gland, the larynx, the columella (corresponding to the stapes in mammals) and, in mammals, the malleus and incus.[14]\n\nCentral nervous system[edit]\nThe central nervous system of vertebrates is based on the hollow dorsal nerve cord running along the dorsal aspect of the notochord. Of particular importance and unique to vertebrates is the presence of neural crest cells, which are progenitor cells critical to coordinating the functions of cellular components.[20] Neural crest cells migrate through the body from the dorsal nerve cord during development, and initiate the formation of neuronal ganglia and structures such as the jaws and skull.[21][22][23] The peripheral nervous system forms when neural crest cells branch out laterally from the dorsal nerve cord and migrate together with the mesodermal somites to innervate the various different structures that develop in the body.\nThe vertebrates are the only chordate group with neural cephalization, and their neural functions are centralized towards a series of vesicular enlargements in the head, which give rise to a brain. A slight swelling of the anterior end of the nerve cord is found in invertebrate chordates such as lancelets (a sister subphylum known as the cephalochordates), though it lacks eyes and other complex special sense organs comparable to those of vertebrates. Other chordates do not show any trends towards cephalization.[14]\nThe rostral end of the neural tube is expanded by a thickening of the walls and expansion of the central canal of spinal cord into three primary brain vesicles: the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain), which are further differentiated in the various vertebrate groups.[24] Two laterally placed retinas and optical nerves form around outgrowths from the midbrain, except in hagfish, though this may be a secondary loss.[25][26] The forebrain is more well-developed in most tetrapods and subdivided into the telencephalon and diencephalon, while the midbrain dominates in many fish and some salamanders. Vesicles of the brain are usually bilaterally symmetrical, giving rise to the paired cerebral hemispheres in mammals.[24]\nThe resulting anatomy of the central nervous system with a single hollow nerve cord dorsal to the gut tube, headed by a series of (typically paired) brain vesicles, is unique to vertebrates. Other invertebrates with well-developed central nervous systems such as arthropods and cephalopods, have a ventral nerve cord made of segmental ganglia on the opposite side of the gut tube, with a split brain stem circumventing the foregut around each side to form a brain on the dorsal side of the mouth.[14]\nAnother distinct neural feature of vertebrates is the axonal/dendritic myelination in both central (via oligodendrocytes) and peripheral nerves (via neurolemmocytes). Although myelin insulation is not unique to vertebrates — many annelids and arthropods also have myelin sheath formed by glia cells, with the Kuruma shrimp having twice the conduction velocity of any vertebrates — vertebrate myelination is annular and non-fenestrated, and the combination of myelination and encephalization have given vertebrates a unique advantage in developing higher neural functions such as complex motor coordination and cognition. It also allows\nvertebrates to evolve larger sizes while still maintaining considerable body reactivity, speed and agility (in contrast, invertebrates typically become sensorily slower and motorically clumsier with larger sizes), which are crucial for the eventual adaptive success of vertebrates in seizing dominant niches of higher trophic levels in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\n\nMolecular signatures[edit]\nIn addition to the morphological characteristics used to define vertebrates (i.e. the presence of a notochord, the development of a vertebral column from the notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal gills, a post-anal tail, etc.), molecular markers known as conserved signature indels (CSIs) in protein sequences have been identified and provide distinguishing criteria for the subphylum Vertebrata.[27] Specifically, 5 CSIs in the following proteins: protein synthesis elongation factor-2 (EF-2), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), adenosine kinase (AdK) and a protein related to ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase are exclusively shared by all vertebrates and reliably distinguish them from all other metazoan.[27] The CSIs in these protein sequences are predicted to have important functionality in vertebrates.\nA specific relationship between Vertebrates and Tunicates is also strongly supported by two CSIs found in the proteins Rrp44 (associated with exosome complex) and serine palmitoyltransferase, that are exclusively shared by species from these two subphyla but not Cephalochordates, indicating Vertebrates are more closely related to Tunicates than Cephalochordates.[27]\n\nEvolutionary history[edit]\nSee also: Evolution of fish and Evolution of tetrapods\nExternal relationships[edit]\nOriginally, the \"Notochordata hypothesis\" suggested that the Cephalochordata is the sister taxon to Craniata (Vertebrata). This group, called the Notochordata, was placed as sister group to the Tunicata (Urochordata). Although this was once the leading hypothesis,[28] studies since 2006 analyzing large sequencing datasets strongly support Olfactores (tunicates + vertebrates) as a monophyletic clade,[29][30][27] and the placement of Cephalochordata as sister-group to Olfactores (known as the \"Olfactores hypothesis\"). As chordates, they all share the presence of a notochord, at least during a stage of their life cycle.\nThe following cladogram summarizes the systematic relationships between the Olfactores (vertebrates and tunicates) and the Cephalochordata.\n\n\n\n\n Chordata \n\n\n\n\n\n Cephalochordata \n\n\n Amphioxiformes (lancelets) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlfactores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tunicata/Urochordata (sea squirts, salps, larvaceans) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Craniata \n\n\n Vertebrata \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst vertebrates[edit]\nThe early vertebrate Haikouichthys\nVertebrates originated during the Cambrian explosion, which saw a rise in organism diversity. The earliest known vertebrates belongs to the Chengjiang biota[31] and lived about 518 million years ago.[1] These include Haikouichthys, Myllokunmingia,[31] Zhongjianichthys,[32] and probably Haikouella.[33] Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail.[34] All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.[35][page needed] A vertebrate group of uncertain phylogeny, small eel-like conodonts, are known from microfossils of their paired tooth segments from the late Cambrian to the end of the Triassic.[36]\n\nFrom fish to amphibians[edit]\nAcanthostega, a fish-like early labyrinthodont.\nThe first jawed vertebrates may have appeared in the late Ordovician (~445 mya) and became common in the Devonian period, often known as the \"Age of Fishes\".[37] The two groups of bony fishes, the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii, evolved and became common.[38] The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes save for lampreys and hagfish, as well as the Placodermi, a group of armoured fish that dominated the entirety of that period since the late Silurian as well as the eurypterids, dominant animals of the preceding Silurian, and the anomalocarids. By the middle of the Devonian, several droughts, anoxic events and oceanic competition lead a lineage of sarcopterygii to leave water, eventually establishing themselves as terrestrial tetrapods in the succeeding Carboniferous.\n\nMesozoic vertebrates[edit]\nAmniotes branched from amphibious tetrapods early in the Carboniferous period. The synapsid amniotes were dominant during the late Paleozoic, the Permian, while diapsid amniotes became dominant during the Mesozoic. In the sea, the teleosts and sharks became dominant. Mesothermic synapsids called cynodonts gave rise to endothermic mammals and diapsids called dinosaurs eventually gave rise to endothermic birds, both in the Jurassic.[39] After all dinosaurs except birds went extinct by the end of the Cretaceous, birds and mammals diversified and filled their niches.\n\nAfter the Mesozoic[edit]\nThe Cenozoic world saw great diversification of bony fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.[40][41]\nOver half of all living vertebrate species (about 32,000 species) are fish (non-tetrapod craniates), a diverse set of lineages that inhabit all the world\'s aquatic ecosystems, from snow minnows (Cypriniformes) in Himalayan lakes at elevations over 4,600 metres (15,100 feet) to flatfishes (order Pleuronectiformes) in the Challenger Deep, the deepest ocean trench at about 11,000 metres (36,000 feet). Many fish varieties are the main predators in most of the world\'s freshwater and marine water bodies . The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea snakes, penguins, cetaceans).\n\nClassification[edit]\nThere are several ways of classifying animals. Evolutionary systematics relies on anatomy, physiology and evolutionary history, which is determined through similarities in anatomy and, if possible, the genetics of organisms. Phylogenetic classification is based solely on phylogeny.[42] Evolutionary systematics gives an overview; phylogenetic systematics gives detail. The two systems are thus complementary rather than opposed.[43]\n\nTraditional classification[edit]\nTraditional spindle diagram of the evolution of the vertebrates at class level\nConventional classification has living vertebrates grouped into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits. This classification is the one most commonly encountered in school textbooks, overviews, non-specialist, and popular works. The extant vertebrates are:[14]\n\nSubphylum Vertebrata\nClass Agnatha (jawless fishes)\nClass Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes)\nClass Osteichthyes (bony fishes)\nClass Amphibia (amphibians)\nClass Reptilia (reptiles)\nClass Aves (birds)\nClass Mammalia (mammals)\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the Placodermi and the Acanthodii, both considered paraphyletic.\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the phylogeny of early amphibians and reptiles. An example based on Janvier (1981, 1997), Shu et al. (2003), and Benton (2004)[44] is given here († = extinct):\n\nDiversity of various groups of vertebrates through the geologic ages. The width of the bubbles signifies the diversity (number of families).\nSubphylum Vertebrata\n†Palaeospondylus\nInfraphylum Agnatha or Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys and other jawless fishes)\nSuperclass †Anaspidomorphi (anaspids and relatives)\nInfraphylum Gnathostomata (vertebrates with jaws)\nClass †Placodermi (extinct armoured fishes)\nClass Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes)\nClass †Acanthodii (extinct spiny \"sharks\")\nSuperclass Osteichthyes (bony vertebrates)\nClass Actinopterygii (ray-finned bony fishes)\nClass Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes, including the tetrapods)\nSuperclass Tetrapoda (four-limbed vertebrates)\nClass Amphibia (amphibians, some ancestral to the amniotes)—now a paraphyletic group\nClass Synapsida (mammals and the extinct mammal-like reptiles)\nClass Sauropsida (reptiles and birds)\nWhile this traditional classification is orderly, most of the groups are paraphyletic, i.e. do not contain all descendants of the class\'s common ancestor.[44] For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles, mammals and birds; the agnathans have given rise to the jawed vertebrates; the bony fishes have given rise to the land vertebrates; the traditional \"amphibians\" have given rise to the reptiles (traditionally including the synapsids or mammal-like \"reptiles\"), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on phylogeny,[45] organized by their known evolutionary history and sometimes disregarding the conventional interpretations of their anatomy and physiology.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships[edit]\nIn phylogenetic taxonomy, the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks but illustrated as a nested \"family tree\" known as a phylogenetic tree. The cladogram below is based on studies compiled by Philippe Janvier and others for the Tree of Life Web Project and Delsuc et al.,[46][47] and complemented (based on[48],[49] and [50]). A dagger (†) denotes an extinct clade, whereas all other clades have living descendants.\n\nThe galeaspid Nochelaspis maeandrine from the Devonian period\nThe placoderm Dunkleosteus terrelli from the Devonian period\nThe acanthodian fish Diplacanthus acus from the Devonian period\nThe early ray-fin Cheirolepis canadensis from the Devonian period\nThe tetrapodomorph Tiktaalik roseae from the Devonian period\nThe early tetrapod Seymouria from the Permian period\nThe synapsid \"mammal-like reptile\" Dimetrodon limbatus from the Permian period\nThe bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx lithographica from the Jurassic period\n\n\n\nVertebrata/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgnatha/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperoartia (lampreys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyxini (hagfish) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyclostomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Euconodonta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Myllokunmingiida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Pteraspidomorphi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Thelodonti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Anaspida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Galeaspida \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Pituriaspida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Osteostraci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGnathostomata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Antiarchi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Petalichthyida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Arthrodira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Ptyctodontida \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Entelognathus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Acanthodii \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChondrichthyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolocephali (rat fish)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuselachii (sharks, rays)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(cartilaginous fishes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuteleostomi/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActinopterygii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCladistia (bichirs, reedfish) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChondrostei (sturgeons, paddlefishes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeopterygii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolostei (bowfin, gars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeleostei (96% of living fishes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ray‑fins)\n\n\nSarcopterygii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Onychodontiformes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActinistia (coelacanths) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Porolepiformes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDipnoi (lungfishes) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Rhizodontimorpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Tristichopteridae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Tiktaalik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTetrapoda (see below) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(lobe‑fins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteichthyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(jawed vertebrates)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†\"Ostracodermi\"†\"Placodermi\"\n\n\nCraniata\n\nNote that, as shown in the cladogram above, the †\"Ostracodermi\" (armoured jawless fishes) and †\"Placodermi\" (armoured jawed fishes) are shown to be paraphylectic groups, separated from Gnathostomes and Eugnathostomes respectively.[51][52]\nAlso note that Teleostei (Neopterygii) and Tetrapoda (amphibians, mammals, reptiles, birds) each make up about 50% of today\'s vertebrate diversity, while all other groups are either extinct or rare.

Their lack of proper vertebrae (among with other characteristics found in lampreys and jawed vertebrates) led phylogenetic analyses based on morphology to place them outside Vertebrata. Molecular data, however, indicates they are vertebrates closely related to lampreys. A study by Miyashita et al.

They produce haploid gametes by meiosis. The smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse by the process of fertilisation to form diploid zygotes, which develop into new individuals.\n\nInbreeding[edit]\nDuring sexual reproduction, mating with a close relative (inbreeding) often leads to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is considered to be largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations.[56] The effects of inbreeding have been studied in many vertebrate species.\nIn several species of fish, inbreeding was found to decrease reproductive success.[57][58][59]\nInbreeding was observed to increase juvenile mortality in 11 small animal species.[60]\nA common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g. between half- and full siblings).[61] This practice generally has a negative effect on measures of reproductive success, including decreased litter size and puppy survival.[62][63][64]\nIncestuous matings in birds result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression (e.g. reduction in hatchability of eggs and reduced progeny survival).[65][66][67]\n\nInbreeding avoidance[edit]\nAs a result of the negative fitness consequences of inbreeding, vertebrate species have evolved mechanisms to avoid inbreeding.\nNumerous inbreeding avoidance mechanisms operating prior to mating have been described. Toads and many other amphibians display breeding site fidelity. Individuals that return to natal ponds to breed will likely encounter siblings as potential mates. Although incest is possible, Bufo americanus siblings rarely mate.[68] These toads likely recognize and actively avoid close kin as mates. Advertisement vocalizations by males appear to serve as cues by which females recognize their kin.[68]\nInbreeding avoidance mechanisms can also operate subsequent to copulation. In guppies, a post-copulatory mechanism of inbreeding avoidance occurs based on competition between sperm of rival males for achieving fertilization.[69] In competitions between sperm from an unrelated male and from a full sibling male, a significant bias in paternity towards the unrelated male was observed.[69]\nWhen female sand lizards mate with two or more males, sperm competition within the female\'s reproductive tract may occur. Active selection of sperm by females appears to occur in a manner that enhances female fitness.[70] On the basis of this selective process, the sperm of males that are more distantly related to the female are preferentially used for fertilization, rather than the sperm of close relatives.[70] This preference may enhance the fitness of progeny by reducing inbreeding depression.\n\nOutcrossing[edit]\nMating with unrelated or distantly related members of the same species is generally thought to provide the advantage of masking deleterious recessive mutations in progeny[71] (see heterosis). Vertebrates have evolved numerous diverse mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding and promoting outcrossing[72] (see inbreeding avoidance).\nOutcrossing as a way of avoiding inbreeding depression has been especially well studied in birds. For instance, inbreeding depression occurs in the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring are produced as a result of a mating between close relatives. In natural populations of the great tit, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.[73]\nPurple-crowned fairywren females paired with related males may undertake extra-pair matings that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding, despite ecological and demographic constraints.[67]\nSouthern pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways: through dispersal and by avoiding familiar group members as mates.[74] Although both genders disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated.\nCooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.[75] Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently or to join unrelated groups.\n\nParthenogenesis[edit]\nParthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization.\nReproduction in squamate reptiles is ordinarily sexual, with males having a ZZ pair of sex determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair. However, various species, including the Colombian Rainbow boa (Epicrates maurus), Agkistrodon contortrix (copperhead snake) and Agkistrodon piscivorus (cotton mouth snake) can also reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis—that is, they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode—resulting in production of WW female progeny.[76][77] The WW females are likely produced by terminal automixis.[citation needed]\nMole salamanders are an ancient (2.4–3.8 million year-old) unisexual vertebrate lineage.[78] In the polyploid unisexual mole salamander females, a premeiotic endomitotic event doubles the number of chromosomes. As a result, the mature eggs produced subsequent to the two meiotic divisions have the same ploidy as the somatic cells of the female salamander. Synapsis and recombination during meiotic prophase I in these unisexual females is thought to ordinarily occur between identical sister chromosomes and occasionally between homologous chromosomes. Thus little, if any, genetic variation is produced. Recombination between homeologous chromosomes occurs only rarely, if at all.[79] Since production of genetic variation is weak, at best, it is unlikely to provide a benefit sufficient to account for the long-term maintenance of meiosis in these organisms.[citation needed]\n\nSelf-fertilization[edit]\nTwo killifish species, the mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus, are the only known vertebrates to self-fertilize.[80] They produce eggs and sperm by meiosis and routinely reproduce by self-fertilisation. This capacity has apparently persisted for at least several hundred thousand years.[81] Each individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes itself through uniting inside the fish\'s body of an egg and a sperm that it has produced by an internal organ.[82] In nature, this mode of reproduction can yield highly homozygous lines composed of individuals so genetically uniform as to be, in effect, identical to one another.[83][84] Although inbreeding, especially in the extreme form of self-fertilization, is ordinarily regarded as detrimental because it leads to expression of deleterious recessive alleles, self-fertilization does provide the benefit of fertilization assurance (reproductive assurance) at each generation.[83]\n\nPopulation trends[edit]\nThe Living Planet Index, following 16,704 populations of 4,005 species of vertebrates, shows a decline of 60% between 1970 and 2014.[85] Since 1970, freshwater species declined 83%, and tropical populations in South and Central America declined 89%.[86] The authors note that, \"An average trend in population change is not an average of total numbers of animals lost.\"[86] According to WWF, this could lead to a sixth major extinction event.[87] The five main causes of biodiversity loss are land-use change, overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and invasive species.[88]\n\nSee also[edit]\nMarine vertebrate – Marine animals with a vertebrate column\nInvertebrate\nExoskeleton\nSkeletal system of the horse – The skeletal system is made of many interconnected tissues including bone, cartilage, and tendons\nTaxonomy of the vertebrates (Young, 1962) – Classification of spine-possessing animals according to some authorities\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Tetrapoda are cladistically included within Sarcopterygii.[6]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Yang, Chuan; Li, Xian-Hua; Zhu, Maoyan; Condon, Daniel J.; Chen, Junyuan (2018). \"Geochronological constraint on the Cambrian Chengjiang biota, South China\" (PDF).

It borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area[10] and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states.[11]\nAlabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama\'s capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville.[12] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.[13][14] Greater Birmingham is Alabama\'s largest metropolitan area and its economic center.[15]\nOriginally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American Revolutionary War. Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used African American slave labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state\'s economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.\nDuring and after World War II, Alabama grew as the state\'s economy diversified with new industries. NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama\'s economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an aerospace industry. Alabama\'s economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.[16]\nThe state has diverse geography, with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the Deep South, Alabama is predominantly a conservative state, and is known for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American football, particularly at the college level, plays a major part of the state\'s culture.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.[17] In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or AlbÃ amo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).[18] The word\'s spelling varies significantly among historical sources.[19] The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.[19] As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as RiviÃ¨re des Alibamons.[17] Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.[19][20][21] The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U.S.; an estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.[22]\nSources disagree on the word\'s meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning \'plants\' or \'weeds\') and amo (meaning \'to cut\', \'to trim\', or \'to gather\').[19][23][24] The meaning may have been \'clearers of the thicket\'[23] or \'herb gatherers\',[24][25] referring to clearing land for cultivation[20] or collecting medicinal plants.[25] The state has numerous place names of Native American origin.[26][27]\nAn 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant \'Here We Rest\'.[19] This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.[19] Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.[17][19]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Alabama\nPre-European settlement\nThe Moundville Archaeological Site in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the Mississippian culture from 1000 to 1450 CE.\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BCE â€“ 700 CE) and continued until European contact.[28]\nThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.[29][30] This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars\' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).[31] Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.[32]\nAmong the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati.[33] While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.\n\nEuropean settlement\nMain articles: New France, Louisiana (New France), French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), New Spain, Louisiana (New Spain), West Florida, Indian Reserve (1763), American Revolutionary War, Treaty of Paris (1783), Spanish West Florida, Seminole Wars, Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty, Republic of West Florida, and Mississippi Territory\nThe Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region\'s first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702.[34] The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.[35]\nAfter the French lost to the British in the Seven Years\' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.[35][36]\nThomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s.[37] The district\'s boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.[38][39]\nWhat are now Baldwin and Mobile counties became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and finally part of the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.[40][41]\nWith the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.[41][42] Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.[36]\n\n19th century\nMain articles: Organic act Â§ List of organic acts, Alabama Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\n\nBefore Mississippi\'s admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory. The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.[43]\nAlabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.[44]\nCahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.[45] The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.[46][47] Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.[48]\n\nThe main house, built in 1833, at Thornhill in Greene County. It is a former Black Belt plantation.\nSoutheastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners\' wealth grew mainly from slave labor.[48] The area also drew many poor, disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.[46] Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.[49]\nFrom 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama\'s capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.[50] A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.[51][52]\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction\nMain articles: Ordinance of Secession, Confederate States of America, and Alabama in the American Civil War\nBy 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color.[53] On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy\'s capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.\n\nUnion Army troops occupying Courthouse Square in Huntsville, following its capture and occupation by federal forces in 1864\nA company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest\'s battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coattails. This led to them being greeted with \"Yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.[54]\nAlabama\'s slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.[55] Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.[56]\nFollowing the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state\'s first public school system and expanded women\'s rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.[56] Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.[56]\nReconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor\'s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,[56] and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.[57] The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.[58] Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.[58]\n\n20th century\nThe developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test.[59] The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.[60] The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.[58]\nWhile the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.[60] By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.[60] Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.[61]\nThe rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.[48] Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.[62]\n\nThe former Mount Sinai School in rural Autauga County, completed in 1919. It was one of the 387 Rosenwald Schools built in the state.\nBeginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers\' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[62]\nContinued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South.[63][64] Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"historical populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.[65]\nAt the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"Magic City\".[66] By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States.[67] Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.[68]\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial \"gerrymandering\" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.[69]\nIndustrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.[48] Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.[70] Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham\'s industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"[68][71]\nIn the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties.[72][73]\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.[74][75] The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery bus boycott (1955â€“1956), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.[76] These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.[77][78]\nLegal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.[79] According to The New York Times, by 2017, many of Alabama\'s African Americans were living in Alabama\'s cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry.\"[80]\nIn 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.[71] Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.\nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.[69]\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.[81]\nBeginning in the 1960s, the state\'s economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.[82] However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state\'s older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state\'s economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.[83]\n\n21st century\nIn 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.[84]\nA few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty-first century. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 storm upon landfall, struck the state and caused over $18 billion of damage. It was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history.[85] A super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in April 2011 and killed 238 people, devastating many communities.[86]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of Alabama\nSee also: List of Alabama counties and Geology of Alabama\nMap of Alabama from the National Atlas of the United States (2007)\nOno Island in Baldwin County\nMonte Sano State Park in Huntsville\nCathedral Caverns in Marshall County\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.[87] About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.[88]\nAlabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.[88] The state ranges in elevation from sea level[89] at Mobile Bay to more than 2,000 feet (610 m) in the northeast, to Mount Cheaha[88] at 2,413 ft (735 m).[90]\nAlabama\'s land consists of 22 million acres (89,000 km2) of forest or 67% of the state\'s total land area.[91] Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.[92]\n\nThe Natural Bridge Rock in Winston County is the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies.\nAreas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.[93] Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.[94] Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.\nNatural wonders include the \"Natural Bridge\" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns, in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, which features one of the largest cave entrances and one of the largest stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge, in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico;[95] DeSoto Caverns, in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States;[96] Noccalula Falls, in Gadsden, which has a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon, near Phil Campbell, which is home to two waterfalls and six natural bridges and is said to have been a hideout of Jesse James;[97] Stephens Gap Cave, in Jackson County, which has a 143-foot pit and two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America;[98] Little River Canyon, near Fort Payne, one of the nation\'s longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns, near Warrior, which has an underground pool, blind cave-fish, and 260-million-year-old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon, on the Alabamaâ€“Tennessee border.\n\nCliffs at the rim of the Wetumpka meteorite crater\nA 5-mile (8 km)-wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of \"Alabama\'s greatest natural disaster\". A 1,000-foot (300 m)-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.[99] The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (\"star-wound\") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.[100] In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.[101]\n\nClimate\nMain article: Climate of Alabama\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification.[102] The average annual temperature is 64 Â°F (18 Â°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.[103] Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of 56 inches (1,400 mm) of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.[103]\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over 90 Â°F (32 Â°C) throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.\nSouth Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.[104]\n\nTornado damage in Phil Campbell following the statewide April 27, 2011, tornado outbreak\nAlabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.[105] Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.[106]\nThe peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern partâ€”along the Tennessee River Valleyâ€”is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains.\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around 40 Â°F (4 Â°C) in Mobile and around 32 Â°F (0 Â°C) in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include New Year\'s Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is 2 inches (51 mm) per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.\nAlabama\'s highest temperature of 112 Â°F (44 Â°C) was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville. The record low of âˆ’27 Â°F (âˆ’33 Â°C) occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market.[107]\n\n\nMonthly normal high and low temperatures for various Alabama cities [Â°F (Â°C)]\nhide\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\nHuntsvilleBirminghamMontgomeryMobileclass=notpageimage| Cities in Alabama\n\n\nHuntsville[108]\n\nAverage high\n\n48.9(9.4)\n\n54.6(12.6)\n\n63.4(17.4)\n\n72.3(22.4)\n\n79.6(26.4)\n\n86.5(30.3)\n\n89.4(31.9)\n\n89.0(31.7)\n\n83.0(28.3)\n\n72.9(22.7)\n\n61.6(16.4)\n\n52.4(11.3)\n\n71.1(21.7)\n\n\nAverage low\n\n30.7(-0.7)\n\n34.0(1.1)\n\n41.2(5.1)\n\n48.4(9.1)\n\n57.5(14.2)\n\n65.4(18.6)\n\n69.5(20.8)\n\n68.1(20.1)\n\n61.7(16.5)\n\n49.6(9.8)\n\n40.7(4.8)\n\n33.8(1.0)\n\n50.1(10.1)\n\n\nBirmingham[109]\n\nAverage high\n\n52.8(11.6)\n\n58.3(14.6)\n\n66.5(19.2)\n\n74.1(23.4)\n\n81.0(27.2)\n\n87.5(30.8)\n\n90.6(32.6)\n\n90.2(32.3)\n\n84.6(29.2)\n\n74.9(23.8)\n\n64.5(18.1)\n\n56.0(13.3)\n\n73.4(23.0)\n\n\nAverage low\n\n32.3(0.2)\n\n35.4(1.9)\n\n42.4(5.8)\n\n48.4(9.1)\n\n57.6(14.2)\n\n65.4(18.6)\n\n69.7(20.9)\n\n68.9(20.5)\n\n63.0(17.2)\n\n50.9(10.5)\n\n41.8(5.4)\n\n35.2(1.8)\n\n50.9(10.5)\n\n\nMontgomery [110]\n\nAverage high\n\n57.6(14.2)\n\n62.4(16.9)\n\n70.5(21.4)\n\n77.5(25.3)\n\n84.6(29.2)\n\n90.6(32.6)\n\n92.7(33.7)\n\n92.2(33.4)\n\n87.7(30.9)\n\n78.7(25.9)\n\n68.7(20.4)\n\n60.3(15.7)\n\n77.0(25.0)\n\n\nAverage low\n\n35.5(1.9)\n\n38.6(3.7)\n\n45.4(7.4)\n\n52.1(11.2)\n\n60.1(15.6)\n\n67.3(19.6)\n\n70.9(21.6)\n\n70.1(21.2)\n\n64.9(18.3)\n\n52.2(11.2)\n\n43.5(6.4)\n\n37.6(3.1)\n\n53.2(11.8)\n\n\nMobile[111]\n\nAverage high\n\n60.7(15.9)\n\n64.5(18.1)\n\n71.2(21.8)\n\n77.4(25.2)\n\n84.2(29.0)\n\n89.4(31.9)\n\n91.2(32.9)\n\n90.8(32.7)\n\n86.8(30.4)\n\n79.2(26.2)\n\n70.1(21.2)\n\n62.9(17.2)\n\n77.4(25.2)\n\n\nAverage low\n\n39.5(4.2)\n\n42.4(5.8)\n\n49.2(9.6)\n\n54.8(12.7)\n\n62.8(17.1)\n\n69.2(20.7)\n\n71.8(22.1)\n\n71.7(22.0)\n\n67.6(19.8)\n\n56.3(13.5)\n\n47.8(8.8)\n\n41.6(5.3)\n\n56.2(13.4)\n\nFlora and fauna\nMain articles: List of amphibians of Alabama, List of mammals of Alabama, List of reptiles of Alabama, and Trees of Alabama\nA stand of Cahaba lilies (Hymenocallis coronaria) in the Cahaba River, within the Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge\nAlabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.[112][113]\nAlabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state.[112] It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.[114]\nIndigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species,[115] 93 reptile species,[116] 73 amphibian species,[117] roughly 307 native freshwater fish species,[112] and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state.[118] Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.[119][120]\n\nCensus-designated and metropolitan areas\nMain article: List of metropolitan areas of Alabama\n\nCombined statistical areas[121]\n\n\nRank\n\nCombined statistical area\n\nPopulation (2021 estimate)\n\nPopulation (2020 census)\n\n\n1\n\nBirminghamâ€“Hooverâ€“Talladega\n\n1,350,646\n\n1,290,744\n\n\n2\n\nChattanoogaâ€“Clevelandâ€“Dalton[CSA 1]\n\n1,000,303\n\n951,434\n\n\n3\n\nMobileâ€“Daphneâ€“Fairhope\n\n661,964\n\n612,838\n\n\n4\n\nHuntsvilleâ€“Decaturâ€“Albertville\n\n648,217\n\n571,422\n\n\n5\n\nColumbusâ€“Auburnâ€“Opelika[CSA 2]\n\n503,124\n\n448,035\n\n\n6\n\nDothanâ€“Enterpriseâ€“Ozark\n\n200,333\n\n195,890\n\n\n\n^ In Alabama, only Jackson County (2019 population: 51,626; 2010 population: 53,227) is included in the Chattanooga CSA\n\n^ In Alabama, only Lee, Russell, and Chambers Counties (total 2019 population: 255,757; total 2010 population: 227,409) are included in the Columbus CSA\n\n\n\nMetropolitan areas[121]\n\n\nRank\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nPopulation (2021 estimate)\n\nPopulation (2020 census)\n\n\n1\n\nBirminghamâ€“Hoover\n\n1,114,262\n\n1,115,289\n\n\n2\n\nHuntsville\n\n502,728\n\n491,723\n\n\n3\n\nMobile\n\n429,536\n\n430,573\n\n\n4\n\nMontgomery\n\n385,798\n\n386,047\n\n\n5\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n268,191\n\n268,674\n\n\n6\n\nDaphneâ€“Fairhopeâ€“Foley\n\n239,294\n\n231,767\n\n\n7\n\nAuburnâ€“Opelika\n\n177,218\n\n174,241\n\n\n8\n\nDecatur\n\n156,758\n\n156,494\n\n\n9\n\nDothan\n\n151,618\n\n151,007\n\n\n10\n\nFlorenceâ€“Muscle Shoals\n\n147,970\n\n147,137\n\n\n11\n\nAnnistonâ€“Oxfordâ€“Jacksonville\n\n115,972\n\n116,441\n\n\n12\n\nGadsden\n\n103,162\n\n103,436\n\nCities\nMain article: List of cities and towns in Alabama\nStatue of Liberty replica at Liberty Park in Vestavia Hills\nDauphin Street in Mobile\nLighthouse on Guntersville Lake\n\nLargest cities[12]\n\n\nRank\n\nCity\n\nPopulation(2020 census)\n\nCounty(ies)\n\n\n1\n\nHuntsville\n\n221,933\n\nMadison, Limestone, Morgan\n\n\n2\n\nMontgomery\n\n196,986\n\nMontgomery\n\n\n3\n\nBirmingham\n\n196,910\n\nJefferson, Shelby\n\n\n4\n\nMobile\n\n183,289\n\nMobile\n\n\n5\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n110,602\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n\n6\n\nHoover\n\n92,435\n\nJefferson, Shelby\n\n\n7\n\nAuburn\n\n80,006\n\nLee\n\n\n8\n\nDothan\n\n71,235\n\nHouston, Dale, Henry\n\n\n9\n\nMadison\n\n59,785\n\nMadison, Limestone\n\n\n10\n\nDecatur\n\n57,922\n\nMorgan, Limestone\n\n\n11\n\nFlorence\n\n41,690\n\nLauderdale\n\n\n12\n\nPrattville\n\n38,776\n\nAutauga, Elmore\n\n\n13\n\nVestavia Hills\n\n38,292\n\nJefferson, Shelby\n\n\n14\n\nPhenix City\n\n38,267\n\nRussell\n\n\n15\n\nAlabaster\n\n33,945\n\nShelby\n\nDemographics\nMain article: Demographics of Alabama\nAlabama\'s population density, 2010\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n18001,250â€”18109,046623.7%1820144,317[122]1,495.4%1830309,527114.5%1840590,75690.9%1850771,62330.6%1860964,20125.0%1870996,9923.4%18801,262,50526.6%18901,513,40119.9%19001,828,69720.8%19102,138,09316.9%19202,348,1749.8%19302,646,24812.7%19402,832,9617.1%19503,061,7438.1%19603,266,7406.7%19703,444,1655.4%19803,893,88813.1%19904,040,5873.8%20004,447,10010.1%20104,779,7367.5%20205,024,2795.1%2023 (est.)5,108,4681.7%Sources: 1910â€“2020[123]\n\nEthnic origins in Alabama\nMap of counties in Alabama by racial plurality, per the 2020 censusshow Legend     Non-Hispanic White   40â€“50%   50â€“60%   60â€“70%   70â€“80%   80â€“90%   90%+   Black or African American   40â€“50%   50â€“60%   70â€“80%   80â€“90%   \nAccording to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279 on April 1, 2020, which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12%, since the 2010 census.[124] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 (502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state.[125]\nImmigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.[125] The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000). The top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico, China, India, Germany and Guatemala in 2018.[126]\nThe center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.[127]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 3,752 homeless people in Alabama.[128][129]\n\nAncestry\n\nRacial and ethnic composition as of the 2020 census\nshow\n\nRace and ethnicity[130]\n\nAlone\n\nTotal\n\n\nWhite (non-Hispanic)\n\n63.1%\n\n63.1 \n\n66.5%\n\n66.5 \n\n\nAfrican American (non-Hispanic)\n\n25.6%\n\n25.6 \n\n26.9%\n\n26.9 \n\n\nHispanic or Latino[b]\n\nâ€”\n\n\n\n5.3%\n\n5.3 \n\n\nAsian\n\n1.5%\n\n1.5 \n\n2.0%\n\n2 \n\n\nNative American\n\n0.5%\n\n0.5 \n\n2.2%\n\n2.2 \n\n\nPacific Islander\n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n\nOther\n\n0.3%\n\n0.3 \n\n0.8%\n\n0.8 \n\n\nHistorical racial demographics 1990â€“2020\nshow\n\nRacial and ethnic composition\n1990[131]\n2000[132]\n2010[133]\n2020[134]\n\n\nWhite\n73.6%\n71.1%\n68.5%\n64.1%\n\n\nBlack\n25.3%\n26%\n26.2%\n25.8%\n\n\nAsian\n0.5%\n0.7%\n1.1%\n1.5%\n\n\nNative\n0.4%\n0.5%\n0.6%\n0.7%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander\nâ€”\nâ€”\n0.1%\n0.1%\n\n\nOther race\n0.1%\n0.6%\n2%\n2.7%\n\n\nTwo or more races\nâ€”\n1%\n1.5%\n5.1%\n\nThose citing \"American\" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20â€“23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.[135][136][137]\nAlabama has the 5th highest African American population among US states at 25.8% as of 2020.[138]  In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama\'s population younger than age 1 were minorities.[139] The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are American (13.4%), Irish (10.5%), English (10.2%), German (7.9%), and Scots-Irish (2.5%) based on 2006â€“2008 Census data.[140]\nThe Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.[141]\nIn 1984, under the Davisâ€“Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission.[142] Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following.[143]\n\nPoarch Band of Creek Indians (who also have federal recognition)\nMOWA Band of Choctaw Indians\nStar Clan of Muscogee Creeks\nEchota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama\nCherokee Tribe of Northeast Alabama\nCher-O-Creek Intra Tribal Indians\nMa-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe\nPiqua Shawnee Tribe\nAni-Yun-Wiya Nation\nThe state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.[144]\n\nLanguage\nMost Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000.\n\n\nTop non-English languages spoken in Alabama\n\n\nLanguage\nPercentage of population(as of 2010[update])[citation needed]\n\n\nSpanish\n2.2%\n\n\nGerman\n0.4%\n\n\nFrench (incl.

Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.[148] A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010[update], the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.[149]\nIn Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCAâ€”28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)â€”26,247 members in 147 congregations,[150] the Cumberland Presbyterian Churchâ€”6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in Americaâ€”5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).[151]\nIn a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a \"full understanding\" of their faith and needed no further learning.[152] In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.[153][154]\nAlthough in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.[151]\nJews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London.[155] The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha\'arai Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844.[155] Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox, four Conservative, ten Reform, and one Humanistic synagogue.[156]\nMuslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.[157]\nSeveral Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa.[158][159]\nThere are six Dharma centers and organizations for Theravada Buddhists.[160] Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter.[161] The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.[162][163][164]\nThe first community of adherents of the BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope. BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Huntsville, and Florence.[165]\n\nHealth\nIn 2018, life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years, below the national average of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country. Factors that can cause lower life expectancy are maternal mortality, suicide, and gun crimes.[166]\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem, with most counties having more than 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%.[167] Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time.[168] Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.[169][170]\n\nEconomy\nSee also: Economy of Alabama and Alabama locations by per capita income\nThe state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about one percent of the state\'s gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.[171]\n\nThe Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail has a large economic impact on the state.\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.[16]\n\nThe Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama\'s 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information.[172] In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.[173]\nThe state\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015.[174] This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.[175]\nAlabama has no minimum wage and in February 2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one. (A Birmingham city ordinance would have raised theirs to $10.10.)[176]\nAs of 2018[update], Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S.[177] In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.[178]\n\nLargest employers\nThe Space Shuttle Enterprise being tested at Marshall Space Flight Center in 1978\nHyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama in Montgomery in 2010\nShelby Hall, School of Computing, at the University of South Alabama in Mobile\nThe five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:[179]\n\n\n\nEmployer\n\nEmployees\n\n\nRedstone Arsenal\n\n25,373\n\n\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham (includes UAB Hospital)\n\n18,750\n\n\nMaxwell Air Force Base\n\n12,280\n\n\nState of Alabama\n\n9,500\n\n\nMobile County Public School System\n\n8,100\n\nThe next twenty largest employers, as of 2011[update], included:[180]\n\n\n\nEmployer\n\nLocation\n\n\nAnniston Army Depot\n\nAnniston\n\n\nAT&T\n\nMultiple\n\n\nAuburn University\n\nAuburn\n\n\nBaptist Medical Center South\n\nMontgomery\n\n\nBirmingham City Schools\n\nBirmingham\n\n\nCity of Birmingham\n\nBirmingham\n\n\nDCH Health System\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n\nHuntsville City Schools\n\nHuntsville\n\n\nHuntsville Hospital System\n\nHuntsville\n\n\nHyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama\n\nMontgomery\n\n\nInfirmary Health System\n\nMobile\n\n\nJefferson County Board of Education\n\nBirmingham\n\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center\n\nHuntsville\n\n\nMercedes-Benz U.S. International\n\nVance\n\n\nMontgomery Public Schools\n\nMontgomery\n\n\nRegions Financial Corporation\n\nMultiple\n\n\nBoeing\n\nMultiple\n\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n\nUniversity of South Alabama\n\nMobile\n\n\nWalmart\n\nMultiple\n\nAgriculture\nAlabama\'s agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as \"The Cotton State\", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports,[181][182] with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three.\n\nAquaculture\nAquaculture is a large part of the economy of Alabama.[183] Alabamians began to practice aquaculture in the early 1960s.[184] U.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th most popular seafood product in America.[185] By 2008, approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by the catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish.[183] In 2020, Alabama produced 1â„3 of the United States\' farm-raised catfish.[185] The total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $307 million but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442.[185]\nFrom the early 2000s to 2020, the Alabamian catfish industry has declined from 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors.[185] Reasons for this decline include increased feed prices, catfish alternatives, COVID-19\'s impact on restaurant sales, disease, and fish size.[185]\n\nIndustry\nAlabama\'s industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. In addition, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, the location of NASA\'s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command, headquartered at Redstone Arsenal.\n\nMercedes-Benz U.S. International in Tuscaloosa County was the first automotive facility to locate within the state.\nA great deal of Alabama\'s economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state\'s expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.[186]\nAutomakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012.[187] The eight models produced at the state\'s auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.[188]\n\nAirbus Mobile Engineering Center at the Brookley Aeroplex in Mobile\nSteel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility.[189] ThyssenKrupp\'s stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012.[190] The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6 billion in March 2013. Companhia SiderÃºrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion.[191] In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.[192]\nThe Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and Moundville.[193] JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.[194]\nThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large plant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929.\nConstruction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice BrÃ©gier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017.b[195][196] The assembly plant is the company\'s first factory to be built within the United States.[197] It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.[198] The factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.[199]\n\nTourism and entertainment\nAlabama\'s beaches are one of the state\'s major tourist destinations.\nAccording to Business Insider, Alabama ranked 14th in most popular states to visit in 2014.[200] An estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $14.3 billion, providing directly or indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state,[201] which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $589 million.[202]\nThe state is home to various attractions, natural features, parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe, notably the annual Hangout Music Festival, held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world;[203] the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, a collection of championship caliber golf courses distributed across the state; casinos such as Victoryland; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure; the Riverchase Galleria, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast; Guntersville Lake, voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers;[204] and the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the oldest museum in the state.[205]\n\nMobile is the birthplace of Mardi Gras in the U.S.\nMobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebration in the United States, beginning in 1703.[206] It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the United States in 1830, a tradition that continues to this day.[206] Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties.[207]\nIn 2018, Mobile\'s Mardi Gras parade was the state\'s top event, producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811. The top attraction was the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville with an attendance of 849,981, followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090. Of the parks and natural destinations, Alabama\'s Gulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors.[208]\nAlabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots due to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments.[209] Movies filmed in Alabama include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Get Out, 42, Selma, Big Fish, The Final Destination, Due Date, and Need for Speed.[210]\n\nHealthcare\nUAB Hospital, USA Health University Hospital, Huntsville Hospital, and Children\'s Hospital of Alabama are the only Level I trauma centers in Alabama.[211] UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.[212] A 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84% followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7%.[213]\n\nBanking\nRegions-Harbert Plaza, Regions Center, and Wells Fargo Tower in Birmingham\'s financial district\nRegions Financial Corporation is the largest bank headquartered in or operating in Alabama. PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo also have a major presence in Alabama.[214]\nWells Fargo has a regional headquarters, an operations center campus, and a $400 million data center in Birmingham. Many smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham area, including ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Harbert Management Corporation.\n\nElectronics and communications\nTelecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham.\nMany technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as ADTRAN, a network access company; Intergraph, a computer graphics company; and Avocent, an IT infrastructure company.\n\nConstruction\nBrasfield & Gorrie, BE&K, Hoar Construction, and B.L.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism.\n\nThe Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building in Montgomery. It houses the Supreme Court of Alabama, Alabama Court of Civil Appeals, and Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.\nAlabama\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n\nRepublican Kay Ivey is the governor of Alabama as of 2024.\nThe executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the governor of Alabama. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.\nThe members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.[220]\nThe judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The state\'s highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.[221] The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.[221]\nAlabama has the death penalty with authorized methods of execution that include the electric chair and the gas chamber.[222] Some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions.[223] Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger.[224] However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas.[225] Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned[226] 24 convictions in death penalty cases.[citation needed] It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries.[224] This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.[227]\nOn May 14, 2019, Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a \"serious health risk\", with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law subjects doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment.[228] The law was originally supposed to take effect the following November, but on October 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.[229] On June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health Organization, Judge Thompson lifted the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.[230]\nAlabama is one of the very few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries.[231]\n\nTaxes\nTaxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue.[232] Alabama levies a 2%, 4%, or 5% personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status.[233] Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax).[234]\nThe state\'s general sales tax rate is 4%.[235] Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.[236] For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile County, Alabama is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile County, Alabama would pay an 11% tax on a meal.\nIn 2020, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 38% of all state and local revenue.[237]\nOnly Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate.[238]\nThe corporate income tax rate in Alabama is 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.[239]\nProperty taxes of .40% of assessed value per year, are the second-lowest in the U.S., after Hawaii.[240] The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.\n\nCounty and local governments\nSee also: List of counties in Alabama\nAlabama counties (clickable map)\nAlabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.[241] Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"[241]\nAlabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.[242]\n\n\n\nRank\nCounty\nPopulation(2019 Estimate)\nPopulation(2010 Census)\nSeat\nLargest city\n\n\n1\n\nJefferson\n\n658,573\n\n658,158\n\nBirmingham\n\nBirmingham\n\n\n2\n\nMobile\n\n413,210\n\n412,992\n\nMobile\n\nMobile\n\n\n3\n\nMadison\n\n372,909\n\n334,811\n\nHuntsville\n\nHuntsville\n\n\n4\n\nMontgomery\n\n226,486\n\n229,363\n\nMontgomery\n\nMontgomery\n\n\n5\n\nShelby\n\n217,702\n\n195,085\n\nColumbiana\n\nHoover (part)Alabaster\n\n\n6\n\nBaldwin\n\n223,234\n\n182,265\n\nBay Minette\n\nDaphne\n\n\n7\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n209,355\n\n194,656\n\nTuscaloosa\n\nTuscaloosa\n\n\n8\n\nLee\n\n164,542\n\n140,247\n\nOpelika\n\nAuburn\n\n\n9\n\nMorgan\n\n119,679\n\n119,490\n\nDecatur\n\nDecatur\n\n\n10\n\nCalhoun\n\n113,605\n\n118,572\n\nAnniston\n\nAnniston\n\n\n11\n\nHouston\n\n105,882\n\n101,547\n\nDothan\n\nDothan\n\n\n12\n\nEtowah\n\n102,268\n\n104,303\n\nGadsden\n\nGadsden\n\n\n13\n\nLimestone\n\n98,915\n\n82,782\n\nAthens\n\nAthens\n\n\n14\n\nMarshall\n\n96,774\n\n93,019\n\nGuntersville\n\nAlbertville\n\n\n15\n\nLauderdale\n\n92,729\n\n92,709\n\nFlorence\n\nFlorence\n\nPolitics\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state\'s only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964[77] and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\nIn 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.[243] In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.[244]\nAs of February 2023[update], there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.[245]\nThe 2023 American Values Atlas by Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of Alabama residents support same-sex marriage.[246]\n\nElections\nMain article: Elections in Alabama\nSenator Doug Jones won a special election in 2017.\nState elections\nWith the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"Solid South\", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the general election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\nMembers of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama[247] and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper Sr.[248] Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.[citation needed] The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.[249][250][251]\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999â€“2003), Kay Ivey (2011â€“2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019â€“present).\n\nLocal elections\nMany local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, mayors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats.[252][253] Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly most rural counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary. However, since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country, Republicans have the upper hand in government.\nAlabama\'s 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts. The current split is 18 Democrats, and 49 Republicans as of 2023. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population. The state of Alabama has and 11 African-American sheriffs.[254]\n\nFederal elections\nThe state\'s two U.S. senators are Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville, both of whom are Republican. In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Jerry Carl, Mike Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Dale Strong, Barry Moore, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell, who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.\n\nEducation\nMain article: Education in Alabama\nPrimary and secondary education\nVestavia Hills High School in the suburbs of Birmingham\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.[255]\nPublic school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006â€“2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.\nWhile Alabama\'s public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama\'s high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).[256] The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.[257] According to National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEAP), Alabama ranks 39 in reading and 40 in math among fourth-grade students in the rankings from 2022.[1]\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011â€“2012 school year.[c][258] The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.[258]\n\nColleges and universities\nMain article: List of colleges and universities in Alabama\nHarrison Plaza at the University of North Alabama in Florence. The school was chartered as LaGrange College by the Alabama Legislature in 1830.\nAlabama\'s programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicineâ€”Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.[259]\n\nWilliam J. Samford Hall at Auburn University\nThe largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016.[260] Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.[261][262]\nAccreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),[263] the Council on Occupational Education (COE),[264] and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).[265]\nAccording to the 2011 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, Auburn University at 36, and University of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).[266]\nAccording to the 2012 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had four tier one universities (University of Alabama, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama in Huntsville).[267]\n\nMedia\nSee also: Category:Mass media in Alabama and List of newspapers in Alabama\nMajor newspapers include Birmingham News, Mobile Press-Register, and Montgomery Advertiser.[268]\nMajor television network affiliates in Alabama include:\n\n\nABC\nWGWW 40.2 ABC, Anniston\nWBMA 58/WABM 68.2 ABC, Birmingham\nWDHN 18 ABC, Dothan\nWAAY 31 ABC, Huntsville\nWEAR 3 ABC Pensacola, Florida/Mobile\nWNCF 32 ABC, Montgomery\nWDBB 17.2 ABC, Tuscaloosa\nCBS\nWIAT 42 CBS, Birmingham\nWTVY 4 CBS, Dothan\nWHNT 19 CBS, Huntsville\nWKRG 5 CBS, Mobile\nWAKA 8 CBS, Selma/Montgomery\nFox\nWBRC 6 FOX, Birmingham\nWZDX 54 FOX, Huntsville\nWALA 10 FOX, Mobile\nWCOV 20 FOX, Montgomery\nWDFX 34 FOX, Ozark/Dothan\nNBC\nWVTM 13 NBC, Birmingham\nWRGX 23 NBC, Dothan\nWAFF 48 NBC, Huntsville\nWPMI 15 NBC, Mobile\nWSFA 12 NBC, Montgomery\nPBS/Alabama Public Television\nWBIQ 10 PBS, Birmingham\nWIIQ 41 PBS, Demopolis\nWDIQ 2 PBS, Dozier\nWFIQ 36 PBS, Florence\nWHIQ 25 PBS, Huntsville\nWGIQ 43 PBS, Louisville[269]\nWEIQ 42 PBS, Mobile\nWAIQ 26 PBS, Montgomery\nWCIQ 7 PBS, Mount Cheaha\nThe CW\nWTTO 21, Homewood/Birmingham\nWTVY 4.3, Dothan\nWHDF 15, Florence/Huntsville\nWFNA 55, Gulf Shores/Mobile/Pensacola, FL\nWDBB 17, Tuscaloosa\nWBMM 22, Tuskegee/Montgomery\n\nCulture\nThis section needs expansion.

Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races.\nThe ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980.\nAlabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour).\n\nCollege sports\nCollege football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference. Alabama averages over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averages over 80,000â€”both numbers among the top twenty in the nation.[270] Bryantâ€“Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821,[271] and is the fifth largest stadium in America.[272] Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.[273]\nProtective Stadium is home of the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl.

I-22 enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: I-165 in Mobile, I-359 in Tuscaloosa, I-459 around Birmingham, I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville, and I-759 in Gadsden. A sixth route, I-685, will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, I-222 has been proposed, as well.\nSeveral U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as U.S. Route 11 (US-11), US-29, US-31, US-43, US-45, US-72, US-78, US-80, US-82, US-84, US-90, US-98, US-231, US-278, US-280, US-331, US-411, and US-431.\nThere are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and Northport; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in Orange Beach.\n\nPorts\nThe Port of Mobile, Alabama\'s only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennesseeâ€“Tombigbee Waterway. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.[277] The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011.[278] The state\'s other ports are on rivers with access to the Gulf of Mexico.\nWater ports of Alabama, listed from north to south:\n\n\n\n\n\nPort name\n\nLocation\n\nConnected to\n\n\nPort of Florence\nFlorence/Muscle Shoals, on Pickwick Lake\nTennessee River\n\n\nPort of Decatur\nDecatur, on Wheeler Lake\nTennessee River\n\n\nPort of Demopolis\nDemopolis, on Tombigbee River\nTennesseeâ€“Tombigbee Waterway\n\n\nPort of Guntersville\nGuntersville, on Lake Guntersville\nTennessee River\n\n\nPort of Birmingham\nBirmingham, on Black Warrior River\nTennesseeâ€“Tombigbee Waterway\n\n\nPort of Tuscaloosa\nTuscaloosa, on Black Warrior River\nTennesseeâ€“Tombigbee Waterway\n\n\nPort of Montgomery\nMontgomery, on Woodruff Lake\nAlabama River\n\n\nPort of Mobile\nMobile, on Mobile Bay\nGulf of Mexico\n\n\nSee also\n\nAlabama portalUnited States portal\nIndex of Alabama-related articles\nOutline of Alabama â€” organized list of topics about Alabama\nUSS Alabama, 7 ships\n\nNotes\nSubnotes\n\n\n^ The relevant note on p. 10 erroneously switches the population values for Perry and Washington counties.

It borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the Yukon territory  to the east; it shares a western maritime border in the Bering Strait with Russia\'s Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean lie to the north and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. Technically a semi-exclave of the U.S., it is the largest exclave in the world.\nAlaska is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states of Texas, California and Montana combined, and is the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but is, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, the continent\'s most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[6]  The state contains the second-largest and largest cities in the United States by area: the state capital of Juneau, and its former capital, Sitka, respectively. The state\'s most populous city is Anchorage and approximately half of Alaska\'s residents live within its metropolitan area.\nIndigenous people have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, and it is widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. The Russian Empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state, and promoted and maintained a native Alaskan Creole population.[7] The expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to $157 million in 2023). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.[8]\nAbundant natural resources have enabled Alaskaâ€”with one of the smallest state economiesâ€”to have one of the highest per capita incomes, with commercial fishing, and the extraction of natural gas and oil, dominating Alaska\'s economy. U.S. Armed Forces bases and tourism also contribute to the economy; more than half the state is federally-owned land containing national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges. It is among the most irreligious states, one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana, and is known for its libertarian-leaning political culture, generally supporting the Republican Party in national elections. The Indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the second highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent, after only Hawaii.[9]\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe name \"Alaska\" (Russian: ĞĞ»ÑÌÑĞºĞ°, romanized: AljÃ¡ska) was introduced in the Russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the Alaska Peninsula. It was derived from an Aleut-language idiom, alaxsxaq, meaning \"the mainland\" or, more literally, \"the object towards which the action of the sea is directed\".[10][11][12]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain articles: Prehistory of Alaska and History of Alaska\nPre-colonization[edit]\nMain article: Alaska NativesNumerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.[13][14] At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. The baby\'s DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene. Ben Potter, the University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward Sun River site in 2013, named this new group Ancient Beringians.[15]\nThe Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.[16]\n\nColonization[edit]\nMain articles: Russian America, Alaskan Creole people, Department of Alaska, District of Alaska, Fairbanks Gold Rush, Kobuk River Stampede, and Nome Gold Rush\nThe Russian settlement of St. Paul\'s Harbor (present-day Kodiak town), Kodiak Island, 1814\nMiners and prospectors climb the Chilkoot Trail during the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush.\nSome researchers believe the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.[17] According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov\'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin, who had visited Alaska in 1764â€“1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River, populated by \"bearded men\" who \"pray to the icons\". Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River.[18]\nThe first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the St. Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M. S. Gvozdev and assistant navigator I. Fyodorov on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian Cossack A. F. Shestakov and Russian explorer Dmitry Pavlutsky (1729â€“1735).[19] Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter. After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\nBetween 1774 and 1800, Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789, a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound. These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Bucareli Sound, and Cordova. Later, the Russian-American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century. Sitka, renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867, on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska, became the capital of Russian America. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeastern Alaska.\nWilliam H. Seward, the 24th United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase (referred to pejoratively as Seward\'s Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. Russia\'s contemporary ruler Tsar Alexander II, the Emperor of the Russian Empire, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland, also planned the sale;[20] the purchase was made on March 30, 1867. Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. In the ceremony 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers marched to the governor\'s house at \"Castle Hill\", where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as Alaska Day, a legal holiday on October 18.\nAlaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a district starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the United States president. A federal district court was headquartered in Sitka. For most of Alaska\'s first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a \"provisional city government\", which was Alaska\'s first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.[21] Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.\n\nU.S. territorial incorporation[edit]\nMain articles: Organic act Â§ List of organic acts, and Territory of Alaska\nStarting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska\'s capital, which had been in Sitka until 1906, was moved north to Juneau. Construction of the Alaska Governor\'s Mansion began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.\n\nU.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the Battle of Attu in May 1943.\nDuring World War II, the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on Attu, Agattu and Kiska, all of which were occupied by the Empire of Japan.[a] During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two United States Navy personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan. About half of the Aleuts died during the period of internment.[22] Unalaska/Dutch Harbor and Adak became significant bases for the United States Army, United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy. The United States Lend-Lease program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\nStatehood[edit]\nSee also: Alaska Statehood Act, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\nBob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening, Alaska\'s inaugural U.S. Senators, hold the 49 star U.S. Flag after the admission of Alaska as the 49th state.\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska\'s Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by the U.S. Congress on July 7, 1958; Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nGood Friday earthquake[edit]\nMain article: 1964 Alaska earthquake\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive Good Friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides. It was the fourth-most-powerful earthquake in recorded history, with a moment magnitude of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 San Francisco earthquake).[23] The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year (spring) and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage. Alaska suffered a more severe megathrust earthquake on July 11, 1585, estimated at magnitude 9.25, which remains the most powerful earthquake recorded in North American history, and the second most powerful earthquake recorded in world history. \nThe Good Friday earthquake lasted 4 minutes and 38 seconds. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other human-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[24] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city.[25] The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe.[26] The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.[25][27]\nThe United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[28] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[28] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.[29] Broadcast journalist, Genie Chance, assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building.[30] She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city\'s police chief.[30] Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.[31]\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[29] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska\'s government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[28]\n\nOil boom[edit]\nThe 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.\n\nOil pooled on rocks on the shore of Prince William Sound after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.\nOil production was not the only economic value of Alaska\'s land. In the second half of the 20th century, Alaska discovered tourism as an important source of revenue. Tourism became popular after World War II, when military personnel stationed in the region returned home praising its natural splendor. The Alcan Highway, built during the war, and the Alaska Marine Highway System, completed in 1963, made the state more accessible than before. Tourism became increasingly important in Alaska, and today over 1.4 million people visit the state each year.[32]\nWith tourism more vital to the economy, environmentalism also rose in importance. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 added 53.7 million acres (217,000 km2) to the National Wildlife Refuge system, parts of 25 rivers to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, 3.3 million acres (13,000 km2) to National Forest lands, and 43.6 million acres (176,000 km2) to National Park land. Because of the Act, Alaska now contains two-thirds of all American national parklands. Today, more than half of Alaskan land is owned by the Federal Government.[33]\nIn 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound, spilling more than 11 million US gallons (42 megalitres) of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine.\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Alaska\nLocated at the northwest corner of North America, Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States, but also has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.[34] Alaska is the only non-contiguous U.S. state on continental North America; about 500 miles (800 km) of British Columbia (Canada) separates Alaska from Washington. It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is not usually included in the colloquial use of the term; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called \"the Lower 48\". The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.The largest lake in Alaska is Lake Illiamna.\nThe state is bordered by Canada\'s Yukon and British Columbia to the east (making it the only state to only border a Canadian territory); the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest; the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west; and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska\'s territorial waters touch Russia\'s territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 miles (4.8 km) apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.[35]\n\nAlaska\'s size compared with the 48 contiguous states (Albers equal-area conic projection)\nAt 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2) in total area, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States. Alaska is more than twice the size of the second-largest U.S. state (Texas), and it is larger than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. Alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world. If it was an independent nation, it would be the 18th largest country in the world; almost the same size as Iran.\nWith its myriad of islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000 km) of tidal shoreline. The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the North Pacific. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest, which is actively undergoing continent building.\nOne of the world\'s largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7 m).[36]\nAlaska has more than three million lakes.[37] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700 km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers about 28,957 square miles (75,000 km2) of Alaska.[38] The Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America, covering 2,008 square miles (5,200 km2) alone.[39]\n\nRegions[edit]\nThere are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are five/six regions that the state is most commonly broken up into:\n\nSouth Central[edit]\nMain article: South Central Alaska\nThe most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez.[40]\n\nSoutheast[edit]\nMain article: Southeast Alaska\nAlso referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the contiguous states. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska\'s largest city.[41] The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area and country, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.[42]\n\nInterior[edit]\nMain article: Alaska Interior\nDenali is the highest peak in North America\nThe Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. Fairbanks is the only large city in the region. Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain in North America, and is also located here.\n\nNorth Slope[edit]\nMain article: Alaska North Slope\nThe North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the National Petroleum Reserveâ€“Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.[43] The city of UtqiaÄ¡vik, formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here. The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often considered part of this region. The respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.[44]\n\nSouthwest[edit]\nMain article: Southwest AlaskaSouthwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles (800 km) inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest. The massive Yukonâ€“Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of the Southwest, with the Aleutian Islands often (but not always) being grouped in as well.\nAleutian Islands[edit]\nMain article: Aleutian Islands\nAlthough entirely east of the International Date Line (the triangular kink in the line was agreed upon the US acquisition of Alaska), the Aleutian Islands cross the 180th meridian, such that they contain both the westernmost (Amatignak) and the easternmost (Semisopochnoi.) points in the United States.\nWhile primarily part of Southwest Alaska when grouped economically, the Aleutian islands are sometimes recognized as an alternate group from the rest of the region due to the geographic separation from the continent. More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the International Date Line was drawn west of 180Â° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.\n\nLand ownership[edit]\nAccording to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges.[45] Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (35 million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the world\'s largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares).\nOf the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101 million acres (41 million hectares), its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\nAnother 44 million acres (18 million hectares) are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations\' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. Individual Native allotments are sold on the open market.\nVarious private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.\n\nAlaska Heritage Resources Survey[edit]\nThe Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the U.S. state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey\'s inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old. As of 31 January 2012[update], more than 35,000 sites have been reported.[46]\n\nCities, towns and boroughs[edit]\nFurther information: List of cities in Alaska and List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska\nSee also: List of Alaska locations by per capita income\nAnchorage, Alaska\'s largest city\nFairbanks, Alaska\'s second-largest city and by a significant margin the largest city in Alaska\'s interior\nJuneau, Alaska\'s third-largest city and its capital\nBethel, the largest city in the Unorganized Borough and in rural Alaska\nHomer, showing (from bottom to top) the edge of downtown, its airport and the Spit\nUtqiaÄ¡vik (Browerville neighborhood near Eben Hopson Middle School shown), known colloquially for many years by the nickname \"Top of the World\", is the northernmost city in the United States.\nCordova, built in the early 20th century to support the Kennecott Mines and the Copper River and Northwestern Railway, has been preserved as a fishing community since their closure.\nMain Street in Talkeetna\nAlaska is not divided into counties, as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into boroughs.[47] Delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Convention wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the traditional county system and adopted their own unique model.[48] Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska\'s 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. Unlike county-equivalents in the other states, the boroughs do not cover the state\'s entire land area. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough.\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralizationâ€”state/county/townshipâ€”most of Alaska uses only two tiersâ€”state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska\'s area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.[49]\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).\nThe state\'s most populous city is Anchorage, home to 291,247 people in 2020.[50] The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Denali ($42,245). Yakutat City, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S. by area.\n\nCities and census-designated places (by population)[edit]\nAs reflected in the 2020 United States census, Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places (CDPs).[51] The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated cityâ€“county. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"The Bush\" and are unconnected to that contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists about the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\nOf Alaska\'s 2020 U.S. census population figure of 733,391, 16,655 people, or 2.27% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.[50] Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla. CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North Tongass Highway, Pennock Island and Saxman East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough, in largely remote areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nCommunity name\nType\n2020 Pop.[50]\n\n\n1\nAnchorage\nCity\n291,247\n\n\n2\nFairbanks\nCity\n32,515\n\n\n3\nJuneau\nCity\n32,255\n\n\n4\nKnik-Fairview\nCDP\n19,297\n\n\n5\nBadger\nCDP\n19,031\n\n\n6\nCollege\nCDP\n11,332\n\n\n7\nNorth Lakes\nCDP\n9,450\n\n\n8\nMeadow Lakes\nCDP\n9,197\n\n\n9\nWasilla\nCity\n9,054\n\n\n10\nTanaina\nCDP\n8,817\n\n\n11\nKalifornsky\nCDP\n8,487\n\n\n12\nSitka\nCity\n8,458\n\n\n13\nKetchikan\nCity\n8,192\n\n\n14\nKenai\nCity\n7,424\n\n\n15\nSteele Creek\nCDP\n6,437\n\n\n16\nBethel\nCity\n6,325\n\n\n17\nChena Ridge\nCDP\n6,015\n\n\n18\nSterling\nCDP\n5,918\n\n\n19\nPalmer\nCity\n5,888\n\n\n20\nGateway\nCDP\n5,748\n\n\n21\nKodiak\nCity\n5,581\n\n\n22\nHomer\nCity\n5,522\n\n\n23\nSouth Lakes\nCDP\n5,229\n\n\n24\nFishhook\nCDP\n5,048\n\n\n25\nUtqiaÄ¡vik\nCity\n4,927\n\n\n26\nFarmers Loop\nCDP\n4,704\n\n\n27\nNikiski\nCDP\n4,456\n\n\n28\nSoldotna\nCity\n4,342\n\n\n29\nUnalaska\nCity\n4,254\n\n\n30\nMill Bay\nCDP\n4,216\n\n\n31\nValdez\nCity\n3,985\n\n\n32\nBig Lake\nCDP\n3,833\n\n\n33\nNome\nCity\n3,699\n\n\n34\nButte\nCDP\n3,589\n\n\n35\nGoldstream\nCDP\n3,299\n\n\n36\nKotzebue\nCity\n3,102\n\n\n37\nPetersburg\nCity\n3,043\n\n\n38\nFarm Loop\nCDP\n2,747\n\n\n39\nSeward\nCity\n2,717\n\n\n40\nEielson AFB\nCDP\n2,610\n\n\n41\nCordova\nCity\n2,609\n\n\n42\nEster\nCDP\n2,416\n\n\n43\nDeltana\nCDP\n2,359\n\n\n44\nDillingham\nCity\n2,249\n\n\n45\nFritz Creek\nCDP\n2,248\n\n\n46\nNorth Pole\nCity\n2,243\n\n\n47\nWillow\nCDP\n2,196\n\n\n48\nRidgeway\nCDP\n2,136\n\n\n49\nBear Creek\nCDP\n2,129\n\n\n50\nWrangell\nCity\n2,127\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nCommunity name\nType\n2020 Pop.\n\n\n51\nAnchor Point\nCDP\n2,105\n\n\n52\nHouston\nCity\n1,975\n\n\n53\nPoint MacKenzie\nCDP\n1,852\n\n\n54\nKodiak Station\nCDP\n1,673\n\n\n55\nHaines\nCDP\n1,657\n\n\n56\nAkutan\nCity\n1,589\n\n\n57\nSusitna North\nCDP\n1,564\n\n\n58\nLazy Mountain\nCDP\n1,506\n\n\n59\nCohoe\nCDP\n1,471\n\n\n60\nMetlakatla\nCDP\n1,454\n\n\n61\nHooper Bay\nCity\n1,375\n\n\n62\nDiamond Ridge\nCDP\n1,330\n\n\n63\nPrudhoe Bay\nCDP\n1,310\n\n\n64\nTok\nCDP\n1,243\n\n\n65\nSkagway\nCDP\n1,164\n\n\n66\nFunny River\nCDP\n1,103\n\n\n67\nSalamatof\nCDP\n1,078\n\n\n68\nTalkeetna\nCDP\n1,055\n\n\n69\nSutton-Alpine\nCDP\n1,038\n\n\n70\nCraig\nCity\n1,036\n\n\n71\nBuffalo Soapstone\nCDP\n1,021\n\n\n72\nSalcha\nCDP\n977\n\n\n73\nHealy\nCDP\n966\n\n\n74\nChevak\nCity\n951\n\n\n75\nHoonah\nCity\n931\n\n\n76\nDelta Junction\nCity\n918\n\n\n77\nNinilchik\nCDP\n845\n\n\n78\nSavoonga\nCity\n835\n\n\n79\nPoint Hope\nCity\n830\n\n\n80\nEmmonak\nCity\n825\n\n\n81\nTogiak\nCity\n817\n\n\n82\nKwethluk\nCity\n812\n\n\n83\nSelawik\nCity\n809\n\n\n84\nKnik River\nCDP\n792\n\n\n85\nQuinhagak\nCity\n776\n\n\n86\nUnalakleet\nCity\n765\n\n\n87\nKing Cove\nCity\n757\n\n\n88\nAlakanuk\nCity\n756\n\n\n89\nWomens Bay\nCDP\n743\n\n\n90\nKlawock\nCity\n720\n\n\n91\nHappy Valley\nCDP\n713\n\n\n92\nKipnuk\nCDP\n704\n\n\n93\nNoorvik\nCity\n694\n\n\n94\nAkiachak\nCDP\n677\n\n\n95\nToksook Bay\nCity\n658\n\n\n96\nYakutat\nCDP\n657\n\n\n97\nGustavus\nCDP\n655\n\n\nKotlik\nCDP\n\n\n99\nTwo Rivers\nCDP\n650\n\n\n100\nFox River\nCDP\n644\n\n\nClimate[edit]\nMain article: Climate of Alaska\nAlaska has more acreage of public land owned by the federal government than any other state.[52]\nAlaska is the coldest state in the United States.[53]  The climate in south and southeastern Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification: Cfb), and a subarctic oceanic climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfc) in the northern parts, with cool summers and relatively mild winters. On an annual basis, the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50 in (130 cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in (380 cm).[54] This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.KÃ¶ppen climate types of AlaskaThe climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region\'s proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) of precipitation a year, with around 75 in (190 cm) of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (KÃ¶ppen: Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers.\nThe climate of western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i.e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation.[55]\nThe climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic and is a classic example of a continental subarctic climate, except in a few valleys where the climate approaches humid continental (KÃ¶ppen: Dfb). Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. Summers are warm (albeit generally short) and may have temperatures reaching into the 90s Â°F (the low-to-mid 30s Â°C), while in the long and very cold winters, the temperature can fall below âˆ’60 Â°F (âˆ’51 Â°C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10 in (25 cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.\nThe highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100 Â°F (38 Â°C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8 mi or 13 km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,[56][57] making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.[58][59] The lowest official Alaska temperature is âˆ’80 Â°F (âˆ’62 Â°C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971,[56][57] one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).[60]\nThe climate in the extreme north of Alaska, north of the Brooks Range, is Arctic (KÃ¶ppen: ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in UtqiaÄ¡vik is 34 Â°F (1 Â°C).[61] Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10 in (25 cm) per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.\n\n\nAverage daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected locations in Alaska[62]\n\n\nLocation\n\nJuly (Â°F)\n\nJuly (Â°C)\n\nJanuary (Â°F)\n\nJanuary (Â°C)\n\n\nAnchorage\n65/51\n18/10\n22/11\nâˆ’5/âˆ’11\n\n\nJuneau\n64/50\n17/11\n32/23\n0/âˆ’4\n\n\nKetchikan\n64/51\n17/11\n38/28\n3/âˆ’1\n\n\nUnalaska\n57/46\n14/8\n36/28\n2/âˆ’2\n\n\nFairbanks\n72/53\n22/11\n1/âˆ’17\nâˆ’17/âˆ’27\n\n\nFort Yukon\n73/51\n23/10\nâˆ’11/âˆ’27\nâˆ’23/âˆ’33\n\n\nNome\n58/46\n14/8\n13/âˆ’2\nâˆ’10/âˆ’19\n\n\nUtqiaÄ¡vik\n47/34\n8/1\nâˆ’7/âˆ’19\nâˆ’21/âˆ’28\n\nFlora and fauna[edit]\nMain article: Wildlife of Alaska\nDemographics[edit]\nMain article: Demographics of Alaska\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n188033,426â€”189032,052âˆ’4.1%190063,59298.4%191064,3561.2%192055,036âˆ’14.5%193059,2787.7%194072,52422.3%1950128,64377.4%1960226,16775.8%1970300,38232.8%1980401,85133.8%1990550,04336.9%2000626,93214.0%2010710,23113.3%2020733,3913.3%2023 (est.)733,406[63]0.0%1930 and 1940 censuses taken in preceding autumnSources: 1910â€“2020[64]\n\nThe United States Census Bureau found in the 2020 United States census that the population of Alaska was 733,391 on April 1, 2020, a 3.3% increase since the 2010 United States census.[6] According to the 2010 United States census, the U.S. state of Alaska had a population of 710,231, a 13.3% increase from 626,932 at the 2000 U.S. census.\nIn 2020, Alaska ranked as the 48th largest state by population, ahead of only Vermont and Wyoming.[65] Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2).[66] Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income).[67] As of 2018[update] due to its population size, it is one of 14 U.S. states that still have only one telephone area code.[68]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,320 homeless people in Alaska.[69][70]\n\nRace and ethnicity[edit]\n\nAlaska racial breakdown of population\nhide\n\nRacial composition\n1970[71]\n1990[71]\n2000[72]\n2010[73]\n2020[74]\n\n\nWhite\n78.8%\n75.5%\n69.3%\n66.7%\n59.4%\n\n\nNative\n16.9%\n15.6%\n15.6%\n14.8%\n15.2%\n\n\nAsian\n0.9%\n3.6%\n4.0%\n5.4%\n6.0%\n\n\nBlack\n3.0%\n4.1%\n3.5%\n3.3%\n3.0%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander\nâ€“\nâ€“\n0.5%\n1.0%\n1.7%\n\n\nOther race\n0.4%\n1.2%\n1.6%\n1.6%\n2.5%\n\n\nMultiracial\nâ€“\nâ€“\n5.5%\n7.3%\n12.2%\n\nEthnic origins in Alaska\nMap of the largest racial/ethnic group by borough.

At the survey estimates, 7.8% of the total population was foreign-born from 2015 to 2019.[75] In 2015, 61.3% was non-Hispanic white, 3.4% black or African American, 13.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.2% Asian, 0.9% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 0.3% some other race, and 7.7% multiracial. Hispanics and Latin Americans were 7% of the state population in 2015.[76] From 2015 to 2019, the largest Hispanic and Latin American groups were Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. The largest Asian groups living in the state were Filipinos, Korean Americans, and Japanese and Chinese Americans.[77]\nThe state was 66.7% white (64.1% non-Hispanic white), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from some other race, and 7.3% from two or more races in 2010. Hispanics or Latin Americans of any race made up 5.5% of the population in 2010.[78] As of 2011[update], 50.7% of Alaska\'s population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry).[79] In 1960, the United States Census Bureau reported Alaska\'s population as 77.2% white, 3% black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.[80]\nIn 2018, The top countries of origin for Alaska\'s immigrants were the Philippines, Mexico, Canada, Thailand and Korea.[81]\n\nLanguages[edit]\nFurther information: Alaska Native languages\nAccording to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over the age of five spoke only English at home. About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, about 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog),[82] and about 5.3% spoke other languages at home.[83] In 2019, the American Community Survey determined 83.7% spoke only English, and 16.3% spoke another language other than English. The most spoken European language after English was Spanish, spoken by approximately 4.0% of the state population. Collectively, Asian and Pacific Islander languages were spoken by 5.6% of Alaskans.[84] Since 2010, a total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state\'s 20 indigenous languages,[85] known locally as \"native languages\".\nThe Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects.[86] Most of Alaska\'s native languages belong to either the Eskimoâ€“Aleut or Na-Dene language families; some languages are thought to be isolates (e.g. Haida) or have not yet been classified (e.g. Tsimshianic).[86] As of 2014[update] nearly all of Alaska\'s native languages were classified as either threatened, shifting, moribund, nearly extinct, or dormant languages.[87]\nIn October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state\'s 20 indigenous languages to have official status.[88][89] This bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages, though they have not been adopted for official use within the government. The 20 languages that were included in the bill are:\n\n\nInupiaq\nSiberian Yupik\nCentral Alaskan Yup\'ik\nAlutiiq\nUnangax\nDena\'ina\nDeg Xinag\nHolikachuk\nKoyukon\nUpper Kuskokwim\nGwich\'in\nTanana\nUpper Tanana\nTanacross\nHÃ¤n\nAhtna\nEyak\nTlingit\nHaida\nTsimshian\n\nReligion[edit]\nSee also: Alaska Native religion and Shamanism among Alaska Natives\nSt. Michael\'s Russian Orthodox Cathedral in downtown Sitka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious self-identification in Alaska per the Public Religion Research Institute\'s 2020 survey[90]\n\n  Unaffiliated (37%)  Protestantism (36%)  Catholicism (14%)  Eastern Orthodox (4%)  Mormonism (2%)  Jehovah\'s Witness (1%)  Other (6%)\n\nMultiple surveys have ranked Alaska among the most irreligious states.[91][92]ChangePoint in south Anchorage (left) and Anchorage Baptist Temple in east Anchorage (right) are Alaska\'s largest churches in terms of attendance and membership.\nAccording to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. Of the religious population, roughly 4% were Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 1% Buddhist, 0.2% BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­, and 0.5% Hindu.[93] The largest religious denominations in Alaska as of 2010[update] was the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents; non-denominational Evangelicals with 38,070 adherents; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 32,170 adherents; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents.[94][95] Alaska has been identified, along with Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, as being the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership.[96][97]\nThe Pew Research Center in 2014 determined 62% of the adult population practiced Christianity. Of the Christian denominations, Catholicism was the largest Christian group. When Protestant denominations were combined, Protestantism was the largest Christian tradition, with Evangelicalism being the largest movement within the Protestant group. The unaffiliated population made up the largest non-Christian religious affiliation at 37%. Atheists made up 5% of the population and the largest non-Christian religion was Buddhism. In 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) determined 57% of adults were Christian.[98] By 2022, Christianity increased to 77% of the population according to the PRRI.\nThrough the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020, its Christian population was dominated by non/inter-denominational Protestantism as the single largest Christian cohort, with 73,930 adherents. Roman Catholics were second with 40,280 members; throughout its Christian population, non-denominational Christians had an adherence rate of 100.81 per 1,000 residents, and Catholics 54.92 per 1,000 residents.[99] Per 2014\'s Pew study, religion was seen as very important to 41% of the population, although 29% considered it somewhat important.[100] In 2014, Pew determined roughly 55% believed in God with absolute certainty, and 24% believed fairly certainly. Reflecting the separate 2020 ARDA study, the 2014 Pew study showed 30% attended religious services once a week, 34% once or twice a month, and 36% seldom/never.[100] In 2018, The Gospel Coalition published an article using Pew data and determined non-churchgoing Christians nationwide did not attend religious services often through the following: practicing the faith in other ways, not finding a house of worship they liked, disliking sermons and feeling unwelcomed, and logistics.[101]\nIn 1795, the first Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.[102] Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.[103] In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems).[104] Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.[105][106][107] In 2010, Alaskan Hindus established the Sri Ganesha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu Temple in Alaska and the northernmost Hindu Temple in the world. There are an estimated 2,000â€“3,000 Hindus in Alaska. The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.\nEstimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000.[108][109][110] In 2020, ARDA estimated there were 400 Muslims in the state.[99] The Islamic Community Center of Anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in Anchorage. They broke ground on a building in south Anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014. When completed, the mosque was the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world.[111] There is also a BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ center,[112] and there were 690 adherents in 2020.[99] Additionally, there were 469 adherents of Hinduism and Yoga altogether in 2020, and a small number of Buddhists were present.\n\nEconomy[edit]\nMain article: Economy of Alaska\nSee also: Alaska locations by per capita income and List of Alaska companies\nAerial view of infrastructure at the Prudhoe Bay Oil FieldAs of October 2022, Alaska had a total employment of 316,900. The number of employer establishments was 21,077.[113]\nThe 2018 gross state product was $55 billion, 48th in the U.S. Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.[114] The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state\'s revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska\'s main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, pollock and crab.\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\nEnergy[edit]\nSee also: Natural gas in Alaska, List of power stations in Alaska, and Energy law Â§ Alaska law\nThe Trans-Alaska Pipeline transports oil, Alaska\'s most financially important export, from the North Slope to Valdez. The heat pipes in the column mounts are pertinent, since they disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of permafrost.\nAlaska proven oil reserves peaked in 1973 and have declined more than 60% since then.\nAlaskan oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined more than 75% since then.\nAlaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.[115][116] Prudhoe Bay on Alaska\'s North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although by early 2014 North Dakota\'s Bakken Formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d).[117] Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada\'s enormous Athabasca oil sands field, which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.[118]\nThe Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska\'s bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.[119] Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.[120]\nAlaska\'s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50Â¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.[121] The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.[122][123]\n\nPermanent Fund[edit]\nThe Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\nThe Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.[124] Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund\'s annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years\' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,[125] and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.\nThe Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world.[126]\n\nCost of living[edit]\nThe cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly United States Postal Service (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.[127]\nRural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.[127]\n\nAgriculture and fishing[edit]\nHalibut, both as a sport fish and commercially, is important to the state\'s economy.\nDue to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 60 miles (97 km) southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\nThe Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially the Delta Junction area, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture.\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners, small farms and farmers\' markets in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers\' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.[128] The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.[129]\n\nOversized vegetables on display at the Alaska State Fair (left) and the Tanana Valley State Fair (right)\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. Instead, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.[130]\nHunting for subsistence, primarily caribou, moose, and Dall sheep is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities. An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\nAlaska\'s reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.[131]\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from \"Outside\" (the other 49 US states), and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50Â¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.[132][133]\n\nCulture[edit]\nThis article may need to be cleaned up.

The Stikine River attracts the largest springtime concentration of American bald eagles in the world.\nThe Alaska Native Heritage Center celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska\'s 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.[134]\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Music of Alaska\nInfluences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer Jewel, traditional Aleut flautist Mary Youngblood, folk singer-songwriter Libby Roderick, Christian music singer-songwriter Lincoln Brewster, metal/post hardcore band 36 Crazyfists and the groups Pamyua and Portugal. The Man.\nThere are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the Alaska Folk Festival, the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, the Anchorage Folk Festival, the Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, the Sitka Jazz Festival, the Sitka Summer Music Festival, and the Anchorage Chamber Music Festival. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable. The Anchorage Opera is currently the state\'s only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\nThe official state song of Alaska is \"Alaska\'s Flag\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the flag of Alaska.\n\nFilm and television[edit]\nSee also: List of films set in Alaska\nThe 1983 Disney movie Never Cry Wolf was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film White Fang, based on Jack London\'s 1906 novel and starring Ethan Hawke, was filmed in and around Haines. Steven Seagal\'s 1994 On Deadly Ground, starring Michael Caine, was filmed in part at the Worthington Glacier near Valdez.[135]\nMany reality television shows are filmed in Alaska.

They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on \"Public Safety Officers\" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers\' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.\nMany rural communities in Alaska are considered \"dry\", having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.[144] Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.[145]\nDomestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.[146] Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas. The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old. In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances.[147]\n\nHealth insurance[edit]\nAs of 2022[update], CVS Health and Premera account for 47% and 46% of private health insurance, respectively.[148] Premera and Moda Health offer insurance on the federally-run Affordable Care Exchange.[149]\n\nHospitals[edit]\nMain article: List of hospitals in Alaska\nProvidence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage is the largest hospital in the state as of 2021;[150] Anchorage also hosts Alaska Regional Hospital and Alaska Native Medical Center.\nAlaska\'s other major cities such as Fairbanks and Juneau also have local hospitals.[151] In Southeast Alaska, Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium,  runs healthcare facilities across 27 communities as of 2022, including hospitals in Sitka and Wrangell;[152] although it originally served Native Americans only, it has expanded access and combined with other local facilities over time.[153][154]\n\nEducation[edit]\nThe Kachemak Bay Campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage, located in downtown Homer\nThe Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers many school districts in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka, and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including Nenana Student Living Center in Nenana and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in Galena.[155]\nThere are more than a dozen colleges and universities in Alaska. Accredited universities in Alaska include the University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alaska Southeast, and Alaska Pacific University.[156] Alaska is the only state that has no collegiate athletic programs that are members of NCAA Division I, although both Alaska-Fairbanks and Alaska-Anchorage maintain single sport membership in Division I for men\'s ice hockey.\nThe Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska\'s Institute of Technology.[157] Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer one-week to 11-month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.\nAlaska has had a problem with a \"brain drain\". Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. As of 2013[update], Alaska did not have a law school or medical school.[158] The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.[159]\nBeginning in 1998, schools in rural Alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state, and campuses not meeting the number close. This was due to the loss in oil revenues that previously propped up smaller rural schools.[160] In 2015, there was a proposal to raise that minimum to 25,[161] but legislators in the state largely did not agree.[162]\n\nTransportation[edit]\nMain article: Transportation in Alaska\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, with access only being through ferry or flight;[163] this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.\nThe Interstate Highways in Alaska consists of a total of 1,082 miles (1,741 km). One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Anchorage at Portage. At 2.5 miles (4.0 km), the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.[164] The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sterling Highway, near its intersection with the Seward Highway\n\n\n\nThe Susitna River bridge on the Denali Highway is 1,036 feet (316 m) long.\n\n\n\nAlaska Interstate Highways\n\n\n\nAlaska welcome sign on the Klondike Highway\n\n\nRail[edit]\nBuilt around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links shipping lanes on the North Pacific with Interior Alaska with tracks that run from Seward by way of South Central Alaska, passing through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and North Pole. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad\'s importance in Alaska\'s economy.\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska\'s development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage. It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country. A stretch of about 60 miles (100 km) of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at White Pass Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.\nThese two railroads are connected neither to each other nor any other railroad. The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the Canadian National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles to the southeast. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.[165][166][167] As of 2021, the Alaska-Alberta Railway Development Corporation had been placed into receivership.\nSome private companies provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle.\n\n\n\n\nAn Alaska Railroad locomotive over a bridge in Girdwood approaching Anchorage (2007)\n\n\n\nThe White Pass and Yukon Route traverses rugged terrain north of Skagway near the Canadaâ€“US border.\n\n\nSea[edit]\nMany cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.\n\nThe MV Tustumena (named after Tustumena Glacier) is one of the state\'s many ferries, providing service between the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Chain.\nAlaska\'s well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway. The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.\nIn recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska\'s gulf coast. The population of Ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many daysâ€”up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time.\n\nAir[edit]\nCities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska\'s extremely well developed bush air servicesâ€”an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by many major airlines. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012â€“2013, Alaska received almost two million visitors).[168]\nMaking regular flights to most villages and towns within the state commercially viable is difficult, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.\n\nA Bombardier Dash 8, operated by Era Alaska, on approach to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport\nThe bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world\'s busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.\nIn 2006, Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.[169] In Alaska there are 8,795 active pilot certificates as of 2020.[170]\n\nSnow[edit]\nAnother Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km). The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The \"Serum Run\" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.[171]\nIn areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or \"snow machine\", as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.[172]\n\nCommunication[edit]\nAlaska\'s internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system[173] and, as of late 2011, Alaska Communications advertised that it has \"two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.[174] In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.[175]\n\nLaw and government[edit]\nState government[edit]\nMain article: Government of Alaska\nThe center of state government in Juneau. The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (known colloquially as the \"Spam Can\"), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the John H. Dimond State Courthouse, and the Alaska State Capitol. Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies.\nLike all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and their appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts.\nThe state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.[176]\nThe Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senate. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The governor of Alaska serves four-year terms. The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.\nAlaska\'s court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the superior courts and the district courts.[177] The superior and district courts are trial courts. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.[177]\nThe Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and habeas corpus.[177] The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.[177]\n\nState politics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Alaska\nFurther information: Political party strength in Alaska and Alaska political corruption probe\n\nGubernatorial election results[178]\n\n\nYear\n\nDemocratic\n\nRepublican\n\nOthers\n\n\n1958\n\n59.6% 29,189\n\n39.4% 19,299\n\n\n1962\n\n52.3% 29,627\n\n47.7% 27,054\n\n\n1966\n\n48.4% 32,065\n\n50.0% 33,145\n\n\n1970\n\n52.4% 42,309\n\n46.1% 37,264\n\n\n1974\n\n47.4% 45,553\n\n47.7% 45,840\n\n\n1978\n\n20.2% 25,656\n\n39.1% 49,580\n\n\n1982\n\n46.1% 89,918\n\n37.1% 72,291\n\n\n1986\n\n47.3% 84,943\n\n42.6% 76,515\n\n\n1990\n\n30.9% 60,201\n\n26.2% 50,991\n\n38.9% 75,721[b]\n\n\n1994\n\n41.1% 87,693\n\n40.8% 87,157\n\n\n1998\n\n51.3% 112,879\n\n17.9% 39,331\n\n\n2002\n\n40.7% 94,216\n\n55.9% 129,279\n\n\n2006\n\n41.0% 97,238\n\n48.3% 114,697\n\n\n2010\n\n37.7% 96,519\n\n59.1% 151,318\n\n\n2014\n\n0.0% 0\n\n45.9% 128,435\n\n48.1% 134,658[c]\n\n\n2018\n\n44.4% 125,739\n\n51.4% 145,631\n\n\n2022\n\n24.2% 63,755\n\n50.3% 132,392\n\nAlthough in its early years of statehood Alaska was a Democratic state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican-leaning.[179] Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the Native corporations. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.\nAlaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one\'s home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.[180]\nThe state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the Alaskan Independence Party.[181]\nSix Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.\nAlaska\'s voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington, as well as Washington D.C., as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of cannabis.[182] The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.[183]\n\nVoter registration[edit]\n\n\nParty registration as of January 3, 2024[184]\n\n\nParty\n\nTotal voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nUnaffiliated\n\n353,654\n\n58.70%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n142,955\n\n23.73%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n74,961\n\n12.44%\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan Independence\n\n19,005\n\n3.15%\n\n\n\n\nMinor political groups\n\n11,923\n\n1.98%\n\n\nTotal\n\n602,498\n\n100.00%\n\nTaxes[edit]\nTo finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.[185] It is one of five states with no sales tax, one of seven states with no individual income tax, andâ€”along with New Hampshireâ€”one of two that has neither.[186] The Department of Revenue Tax Division[187] reports regularly on the state\'s revenue sources. The department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division. In 2014, the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most \"business friendly\" tax policy, behind only Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nevada.[188]\nWhile Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0 to 7.5%, typically 3â€“5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast \'bed\' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.\nThe fall in oil prices after the fracking boom in the early 2010s has decimated Alaska\'s state treasury, which has historically received about 85 percent of its revenue from taxes and fees imposed on oil and gas companies.[189] The state government has had to drastically reduce its budget, and has brought its budget shortfall from over $2 billion in 2016 to under $500 million by 2018. In 2020, Alaska\'s state government budget was $4.8 billion, while projected government revenues were only $4.5 billion.[190]\n\nFederal politics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Alaska\nSee also: Arctic Policy of the United States\nA line graph showing the presidential vote by party from 1960 to 2020 in Alaska\nAlaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state\'s electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in (1964). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964, while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. Since 1972, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain\'s running mate was Sarah Palin, the state\'s governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state\'s vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968. In 2020, Joe Biden received 42.77% of the vote for president, marking the high point for a Democratic presidential candidate since Johnson\'s 1964 victory.\nThe Alaska Bush, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing.\n\nElections[edit]\nSee also: Ranked-choice voting in the United States and Nonpartisan blanket primary\nThis section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(December 2020)\nAlaska has had a long history of primary defeats for incumbent U.S. Senators, with Ernest Gruening, Mike Gravel and Lisa Murkowski all defeated for the nomination to their reelection. Murkowski won re-election with a write-in campaign. Despite this, Alaska has had some long-serving members of congress, with Ted Stevens serving as U.S. Senator for 40 years, and Don Young serving as the at-large representative for 49 years.\n\nRepublican Don Young held Alaska\'s sole U.S. House seat for 49 years, from 1973 to 2022.\nIn the 2020 election cycle, Alaskan voters approved Ballot Measure 2.[191] The measure passed by a margin of 1.1%, or about 4,000 votes.[192] The measure requires campaigns to disclose the original source and any intermediaries for campaign contributions over $2,000. The measure also establishes non-partisan blanket primaries for statewide elections (like in Washington state and California) and ranked-choice voting (like in Maine).[192] Measure 2 makes Alaska the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races, the second state with ranked choice voting, and the only state with both.\nThe first race to use the new system of elections was the 2022 special election to fill Alaska\'s only U.S. House seat, left vacant by the death of Don Young, won by Mary Peltola, the first Democrat to win the House seat since 1972, and the first Alaskan Native to be elected to the United States Congress in history.\n\n\nAlaska\'s current statewide elected officials\n\n\nMike Dunleavy, Governor\n\n\n\nNancy Dahlstrom, Lieutenant governor\n\n\n\nLisa Murkowski, senior United States senator\n\n\n\nDan Sullivan, junior United States senator\n\n\n\nMary Peltola, United States congresswoman\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nAlaska portal\nIndex of Alaska-related articles\nOutline of Alaska\nList of boroughs and census areas in Alaska\nUSS Alaska, 4 ships\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ These three Aleutian outer islands are about 460 miles (740 km) away from mainland USSR, 920 miles (1,480 km) from mainland Alaska, 950 miles (1,530 km) from Japan.\n\n^ Wally Hickel would rejoin the Republican party after winning the election as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party.\n\n^ Byron Mallott, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, suspended his campaign and became the running mate of Bill Walker, an independent who left the Republican Party.

It is often roughly divided into the following periods: Mycenaean Greek (c. 1400–1200 BC), Dark Ages (c. 1200–800 BC), the Archaic or Epic period (c. 800–500 BC), and the Classical period (c. 500–300 BC).[1]\nAncient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance. This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical periods of the language, which are the best-attested periods and considered most typical of Ancient Greek.\nFrom the Hellenistic period (c. 300 BC), Ancient Greek was followed by Koine Greek, which is regarded as a separate historical stage, though its earliest form closely resembles Attic Greek, and its latest form approaches Medieval Greek. There were several regional dialects of Ancient Greek; Attic Greek developed into Koine.\n\n\nDialects\nMain article: Ancient Greek dialects\nAncient Greek was a pluricentric language, divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms in literature, while others are attested only in inscriptions.\nThere are also several historical forms. Homeric Greek is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and in later poems by other authors.[2] Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects.\n\nHistory\nThe origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common Proto-Indo-European language and the Classical period. They have the same general outline but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period[a] is Mycenaean Greek, but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form.\nScholars assume that major Ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120 BC, at the time of the Dorian invasions—and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be \"Dorian\" unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical Dorians. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians.\nThe Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek people – Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation.\nOne standard formulation for the dialects is:[3]\n\nDistribution of Greek dialects in Greece in the classical period.[4]\n\n\n\n\nWestern group:  Doric proper  Northwest Doric  Achaean Doric (probably Northwest Doric)\n\n\nCentral group:  Aeolic  Arcado-Cypriot\n\n\nEastern group:  Attic  Ionic\n\n\nDistribution of Greek dialects in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy and Sicily) in the classical period.\n\n\n\n\nWestern group:  Doric proper  Northwest Doric  Achaean Doric (probably Northwest Doric)\n\n\nEastern group:  Attic-Ionic\n\n\n\nWest Group\nNorthwest Greek\nDoric\nAeolic Group\nAegean/Asiatic Aeolic\nThessalian\nBoeotian\nIonic-Attic Group\nAttic\nIonic\nEuboean and colonies in Italy\nCycladic\nAsiatic Ionic\nArcadocypriot Greek\nArcadian\nCypriot\nWest vs. non-West Greek is the strongest-marked and earliest division, with non-West in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-West is called \'East Greek\'.\nArcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age.\nBoeotian Greek had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect, as exemplified in the poems of the Boeotian poet Pindar who wrote in Doric with a small Aeolic admixture.[5] Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree.\nPamphylian Greek, spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence.[6]\nRegarding the speech of the ancient Macedonians diverse theories have been put forward, but the epigraphic activity and the archaeological discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia during the last decades has brought to light documents, among which the first texts written in Macedonian, such as the Pella curse tablet, as Hatzopoulos and other scholars note.[7][8] Based on the conclusions drawn by several studies and findings such as Pella curse tablet, Emilio Crespo and other scholars suggest that ancient Macedonian was a Northwest Doric dialect,[9][10][8] which shares isoglosses with its neighboring Thessalian dialects spoken in northeastern Thessaly.[9][8] Some have also suggested an Aeolic Greek classification.[11][12]\nThe Lesbian dialect was Aeolic. For example, fragments of the works of the poet Sappho from the island of Lesbos are in Aeolian.[13]\nMost of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including Cretan Doric), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including Laconian, the dialect of Sparta), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including Corinthian).\nAll the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects.\nAfter the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as Koine or Common Greek developed, largely based on Attic Greek, but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although the Doric dialect has survived in the Tsakonian language, which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of Demotic Greek. By about the 6th century AD, the Koine had slowly metamorphosed into Medieval Greek.\n\nRelated languages\nMain article: Phrygian language\nPhrygian is an extinct Indo-European language of West and Central Anatolia, which is considered by some linguists to have been closely related to Greek.[14][15][16] Among Indo-European branches with living descendants, Greek is often argued to have the closest genetic ties with Armenian[17] (see also Graeco-Armenian) and Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan).[18][19]\n\nPhonology\nDifferences from Proto-Indo-European\nMain article: Proto-Greek language\nAncient Greek differs from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and other Indo-European languages in certain ways. In phonotactics, ancient Greek words could end only in a vowel or /n s r/; final stops were lost, as in γάλα \"milk\", compared with γάλακτος \"of milk\" (genitive). Ancient Greek of the classical period also differed in both the inventory and distribution of original PIE phonemes due to numerous sound changes,[20] notably the following:\n\nPIE *s became /h/ at the beginning of a word (debuccalization): Latin sex, English six, ancient Greek ἕξ /héks/.\nPIE *s was elided between vowels after an intermediate step of debuccalization: Sanskrit janasas, Latin generis (where s > r by rhotacism), Greek *genesos > *genehos > ancient Greek γένεος (/ɡéneos/), Attic γένους (/ɡénoːs/) \"of a kind\".\nPIE *y /j/ became /h/ (debuccalization) or /(d)z/ (fortition): Sanskrit yas, ancient Greek ὅς /hós/ \"who\" (relative pronoun); Latin iugum, English yoke, ancient Greek ζυγός /zyɡós/.\nPIE *w, which occurred in Mycenaean and some non-Attic dialects, was lost: early Doric ϝέργον /wérɡon/, English work, Attic Greek ἔργον /érɡon/.\nPIE and Mycenaean labiovelars changed to plain stops (labials, dentals, and velars) in the later Greek dialects: for instance, PIE *kʷ became /p/ or /t/ in Attic: Attic Greek ποῦ /pôː/ \"where?\", Latin quō; Attic Greek τίς /tís/, Latin quis \"who?\".\nPIE \"voiced aspirated\" stops *bʰ dʰ ǵʰ gʰ gʷʰ were devoiced and became the aspirated stops φ θ χ /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ in ancient Greek.\nPhonemic inventory\nMain article: Ancient Greek phonology\nThe pronunciation of Ancient Greek was very different from that of Modern Greek. Ancient Greek had long and short vowels; many diphthongs; double and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops; and a pitch accent. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as /i/ (iotacism). Some of the stops and glides in diphthongs have become fricatives, and the pitch accent has changed to a stress accent. Many of the changes took place in the Koine Greek period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes.\nThe examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent.\n\nConsonants\n\n\n\n\nBilabial\n\nDental\n\nVelar\n\nGlottal\n\n\nNasal\n\nμm\n\nνn\n\nγ(ŋ)\n\n\n\n\nPlosive\n\nvoiced\n\nβb\n\nδd\n\nγɡ\n\n\n\n\nvoiceless\n\nπp\n\nτt\n\nκk\n\n\n\n\naspirated\n\nφpʰ\n\nθtʰ\n\nχkʰ\n\n\n\n\nFricative\n\n\n\nσ s\n\n\n\nh\n\n\nTrill\n\n\n\nρr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral\n\n\n\nλl\n\n\n\n\n\n[ŋ] occurred as an allophone of /n/ that was used before velars and as an allophone of /ɡ/ before nasals. /r/ was probably voiceless when word-initial and geminated (written ῥ and ῥῥ). /s/ was assimilated to [z] before voiced consonants.\n\nVowels\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\nunrounded\n\nrounded\n\n\nClose\n\nιi iː\n\nυy yː\n\n\n\n\nClose-mid\n\nε ειe eː\n\n\n\nο ουo oː\n\n\nOpen-mid\n\nηɛː\n\n\n\nωɔː\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\nαa aː\n\n/oː/ raised to [uː], probably by the 4th century BC.\n\nMorphology\nMain article: Ancient Greek grammar\nOstracon bearing the name of Cimon, Stoa of Attalos\nGreek, like all of the older Indo-European languages, is highly inflected. It is highly archaic in its preservation of Proto-Indo-European forms. In ancient Greek, nouns (including proper nouns) have five cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and three numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Verbs have four moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative) and three voices (active, middle, and passive), as well as three persons (first, second, and third) and various other forms. \nVerbs are conjugated through seven combinations of tenses and aspect (generally simply called \"tenses\"): the present, future, and imperfect are imperfective in aspect; the aorist, present perfect, pluperfect and future perfect are perfective in aspect. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice.\n\nAugment\nThe indicative of past tenses adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the augment. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like \"then\", added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the indicative of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist).\nThe two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes e (stems beginning with r, however, add er). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel:\n\na, ā, e, ē → ē\ni, ī → ī\no, ō → ō\nu, ū → ū\nai → ēi\nei → ēi or ei\noi → ōi\nau → ēu or au\neu → ēu or eu\nou → ou\nSome verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is e → ei. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of s between vowels, or that of the letter w, which affected the augment when it was word-initial.\nIn verbs with a preposition as a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the preposition and the original verb. For example, προσ(-)βάλλω (I attack) goes to προσέβαλoν in the aorist. However compound verbs consisting of a prefix that is not a preposition retain the augment at the start of the word: αὐτο(-)μολῶ goes to ηὐτομόλησα in the aorist.\nFollowing Homer\'s practice, the augment is sometimes not made in poetry, especially epic poetry.\nThe augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below.\n\nReduplication\nAlmost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (A few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of reduplication are:\n\nSyllabic reduplication: Most verbs beginning with a single consonant, or a cluster of a stop with a sonorant, add a syllable consisting of the initial consonant followed by e. An aspirated consonant, however, reduplicates in its unaspirated equivalent (see Grassmann\'s law).\nAugment: Verbs beginning with a vowel, as well as those beginning with a cluster other than those indicated previously (and occasionally for a few other verbs) reduplicate in the same fashion as the augment. This remains in all forms of the perfect, not just the indicative.\nAttic reduplication: Some verbs beginning with an a, e or o, followed by a sonorant (or occasionally d or g), reduplicate by adding a syllable consisting of the initial vowel and following consonant, and lengthening the following vowel. Hence er → erēr, an → anēn, ol → olōl, ed → edēd. This is not actually specific to Attic Greek, despite its name, but it was generalized in Attic. This originally involved reduplicating a cluster consisting of a laryngeal and sonorant, hence h₃l → h₃leh₃l → olōl with normal Greek development of laryngeals. (Forms with a stop were analogous.)\nIrregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, lambanō (root lab) has the perfect stem eilēpha (not *lelēpha) because it was originally slambanō, with perfect seslēpha, becoming eilēpha through compensatory lengthening.\nReduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root\'s initial consonant followed by i. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs.[21]\n\nWriting system\nGreek alphabet\n Αα Alpha Νν Nu Ββ Beta Ξξ Xi Γγ Gamma Οο Omicron Δδ Delta Ππ Pi Εε Epsilon Ρρ Rho Ζζ Zeta Σσς Sigma Ηη Eta Ττ Tau Θθ Theta Υυ Upsilon Ιι Iota Φφ Phi Κκ Kappa Χχ Chi Λλ Lambda Ψψ Psi Μμ Mu Ωω Omega\n\nHistory\n Archaic local variants\nϜͰϺϘͲͶ tsandigamma \nDiacritics\nLigatures\n Numerals\nϛ (6)ϟ (90)ϡ (900) \n\nUse in other languages\nBactrian\nCoptic\nAlbanian\n\nRelated topics\nUse as scientific symbols\n\n\n Category\nvte\nMain article: Greek orthography\nThe earliest extant examples of ancient Greek writing (c. 1450 BC) are in the syllabic script Linear B. Beginning in the 8th century BC, however, the Greek alphabet became standard, albeit with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in boustrophedon style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of ancient Greek texts are usually written with accents and breathing marks, interword spacing, modern punctuation, and sometimes mixed case, but these were all introduced later.\n\nSample texts\nThe beginning of Homer\'s Iliad exemplifies the Archaic period of ancient Greek (see Homeric Greek for more details):\n\n\nΜῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος\nοὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί\' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε\' ἔθηκε,\nπολλὰς δ\' ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν\nἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν\nοἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι· Διὸς δ\' ἐτελείετο βουλή·\nἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε\nἈτρεΐδης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.\n\n\nThe beginning of Apology by Plato exemplifies Attic Greek from the Classical period of ancient Greek. (The second line is the IPA, the third is transliterated into the Latin alphabet using a modern version of the Erasmian scheme.)\n\nὍτι[hótiHótiμὲνmenmènὑμεῖς,hyːmêːshūmeîs, | ὦɔ̂ːôἄνδρεςándresándresἈθηναῖοι,atʰɛːnaî̯i̯oiAthēnaîoi, | πεπόνθατεpepóntʰatepepónthate | ὑπὸhypohupòτῶνtɔ̂ːntônἐμῶνemɔ̂ːŋemônκατηγόρων,katɛːɡórɔːnkatēgórōn, | οὐκoːkoukοἶδα·oî̯daoîda: ‖ ἐγὼéɡɔːegṑδ\' οὖνdûːŋd\' oûnκαὶkai̯kaìαὐτὸςau̯tosautòs | ὑπ\'hyphup\'αὐτῶνau̯tɔ̂ːnautōnὀλίγουolíɡoːolígouἐμαυτοῦemau̯tûːemautoû | ἐπελαθόμην,epelatʰómɛːnepelathómēn, | οὕτωhǔːtɔːhoútōπιθανῶςpitʰanɔ̂ːspithanôsἔλεγον.éleɡonélegon. ‖ Καίτοιkaí̯toi̯Kaítoiἀληθέςalɛːtʰézalēthésγεɡege | ὡςhɔːshōsἔποςéposéposεἰπεῖνeːpêːneipeîn | οὐδὲνoːdenoudènεἰρήκασιν.eːrɛ̌ːkaːsineirḗkāsin. ‖] Ὅτι μὲν ὑμεῖς, {} ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, {} πεπόνθατε {} ὑπὸ τῶν ἐμῶν κατηγόρων, {} οὐκ οἶδα· {} ἐγὼ {δ\' οὖν} καὶ αὐτὸς {} ὑπ\' αὐτῶν ὀλίγου ἐμαυτοῦ {} ἐπελαθόμην, {} οὕτω πιθανῶς ἔλεγον. {} Καίτοι ἀληθές γε {} ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν {} οὐδὲν εἰρήκασιν. {}[hóti men hyːmêːs | ɔ̂ː ándres atʰɛːnaî̯i̯oi | pepóntʰate | hypo tɔ̂ːn emɔ̂ːŋ katɛːɡórɔːn | oːk oî̯da ‖ éɡɔː dûːŋ kai̯ au̯tos | hyp au̯tɔ̂ːn olíɡoː emau̯tûː | epelatʰómɛːn | hǔːtɔː pitʰanɔ̂ːs éleɡon ‖ kaí̯toi̯ alɛːtʰéz ɡe | hɔːs épos eːpêːn | oːden eːrɛ̌ːkaːsin ‖]Hóti mèn hūmeîs, {} ô ándres Athēnaîoi, {} pepónthate {} hupò tôn emôn katēgórōn, {} ouk oîda: {} egṑ {d\' oûn} kaì autòs {} hup\' autōn olígou emautoû {} epelathómēn, {} hoútō pithanôs élegon. {} Kaítoi alēthés ge {} hōs épos eipeîn {} oudèn eirḗkāsin. {}How you, men of Athens, are feeling under the power of my accusers, I do not know: actually, even I myself almost forgot who I was because of them, they spoke so persuasively.

This was true as well in the United States, where many of the nation\'s Founders received a classically based education.[22]\nLatin was emphasized in American colleges, but Greek also was required in the Colonial and Early National eras,[23] and the study of ancient Greece became increasingly popular in the mid-to-late Nineteenth Century, the age of American philhellenism.[24] In particular, female intellectuals of the era designated the mastering of ancient Greek as essential in becoming a \"woman of letters.\"[25]\nAncient Greek is still taught as a compulsory or optional subject especially at traditional or elite schools throughout Europe, such as public schools and grammar schools in the United Kingdom. It is compulsory in the liceo classico in Italy, in the gymnasium in the Netherlands, in some classes in Austria, in klasična gimnazija (grammar school – orientation: classical languages) in Croatia, in classical studies in ASO in Belgium and it is optional in the humanities-oriented gymnasium in Germany, usually as a third language after Latin and English, from the age of 14 to 18. In 2006/07, 15,000 pupils studied ancient Greek in Germany according to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, and 280,000 pupils studied it in Italy.[26]\nIt is a compulsory subject alongside Latin in the humanities branch of the Spanish Baccalaureate. Ancient Greek is taught at most major universities worldwide, often combined with Latin as part of the study of classics. In 2010 it was offered in three primary schools in the UK, to boost children\'s language skills,[27][28] and was one of seven foreign languages which primary schools could teach 2014 as part of a major drive to boost education standards.[29][needs update]\nAncient Greek is taught as a compulsory subject in all gymnasiums and lyceums in Greece.[30][31] Starting in 2001, an annual international competition \"Exploring the Ancient Greek Language and Culture\" (Greek: Διαγωνισμός στην Αρχαία Ελληνική Γλώσσα και Γραμματεία) was run for upper secondary students through the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs, with Greek language and cultural organisations as co-organisers.[32] It appears to have ceased in 2010, having failed to gain the recognition and acceptance of teachers.[33]\n\nModern real-world usage\nModern authors rarely write in ancient Greek, though Jan Křesadlo wrote some poetry and prose in the language, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone,[34] some volumes of Asterix,[35] and The Adventures of Alix have been translated into ancient Greek. Ὀνόματα Kεχιασμένα (Onomata Kechiasmena) is the first magazine of crosswords and puzzles in ancient Greek.[36] Its first issue appeared in April 2015 as an annex to Hebdomada Aenigmatum. Alfred Rahlfs included a preface, a short history of the Septuagint text, and other front matter translated into ancient Greek in his 1935 edition of the Septuagint; Robert Hanhart also included the introductory remarks to the 2006 revised Rahlfs–Hanhart edition in the language as well.[37] Akropolis World News reports weekly a summary of the most important news in ancient Greek.[38]\nAncient Greek is also used by organizations and individuals, mainly Greek, who wish to denote their respect, admiration or preference for the use of this language. This use is sometimes considered graphical, nationalistic or humorous. In any case, the fact that modern Greeks can still wholly or partly understand texts written in non-archaic forms of ancient Greek shows the affinity of the modern Greek language to its ancestral predecessor.[38]\nAncient Greek is often used in the coinage of modern technical terms in the European languages: see English words of Greek origin. Latinized forms of ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology.\n\nSee also\nAncient Greek dialects – Varieties of Ancient Greek in classical antiquity\nAncient Greek grammar – Grammar of the Ancient Greek language\nAncient Greek accent\nGreek alphabet – Script used to write the Greek language\nGreek diacritics – Marks added to letters in Greek\nGreek language – Indo-European language\nHellenic languages – Branch of Indo-European language family\nKatharevousa – Former prestige form of the Modern Greek language\nKoine Greek – Dialect of Greek in the ancient world\nList of Greek and Latin roots in English\nList of Greek phrases (mostly ancient Greek)\nMedieval Greek – Medieval stage of the Greek language\nModern Greek – Dialects and varieties of the Greek language spoken in the modern era\nMycenaean Greek – Earliest attested form of the Greek language, from the 16th to the 12th century BC\nProto-Greek language – Last common ancestor of all varieties of Greek\nVarieties of Modern Greek – Dialects and differences between the written standard and spoken speech\nNotes\n\n\n^ Mycenaean Greek is imprecisely attested and somewhat reconstructive due to its being written in an ill-fitting syllabary (Linear B).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Ralli, Angela (2012). \"Greek\".

Arizona is part of the Four Corners region with Utah to the north, Colorado to the northeast, and New Mexico to the east; its other neighboring states are Nevada to the northwest, California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest. It is the 6th-largest and the 14th-most-populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix.\nArizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California and Nuevo MÃ©xico in New Spain, it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexicanâ€“American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848, where the area became part of the territory of New Mexico. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.\nSouthern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Sunrise, and Tucson. In addition to the internationally known Grand Canyon National Park, which is one of the world\'s seven natural wonders, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments.\nArizona\'s population and economy have grown dramatically since the 1950s because of inward migration, and the state is now a major hub of the Sun Belt. Cities such as Phoenix and Tucson have developed large, sprawling suburban areas. Many large companies, such as PetSmart and Circle K,[12] have headquarters in the state, and Arizona is home to major universities, including the University of Arizona and Arizona State University. The state is known for a history of conservative politicians such as Barry Goldwater and John McCain, though it has become a swing state since the 1990s.\nArizona is home to a diverse population. About one-quarter of the state[13][14] is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Since the 1980s, the proportion of Hispanics in the state\'s population has grown significantly owing to migration from Mexico. A substantial portion of the population are followers of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe state\'s name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, Arizonac, derived from the O\'odham name alÄ­ á¹£onak, meaning \'small spring\'. Initially this term was applied by Spanish colonists only to an area near the silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata, Sonora.[15][16][17][18] To the European settlers, the O\'odham pronunciation sounded like Arissona.[19] The area is still known as alÄ­ á¹£onak in the O\'odham language.[11]\nAnother possible origin is the Basque phrase haritz ona \'the good oak\', as there were numerous Basque sheepherders in the area.[20][21][22] A native-born Mexican of Basque ancestry established the rancherÃ­a (small rural settlement) of Arizona between 1734 and 1736 in the current Mexican state of Sonora. It became notable after a significant discovery of silver there around 1737.[23]\nThe misconception that the state\'s name purportedly originated from the Spanish term Ãrida Zona \'Arid Zone\' is considered a case of folk etymology.[19]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Arizona\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Arizona.\nFor thousands of years before the modern era, Arizona was home to many ancient Native American civilizations. Hohokam, Mogollon, and Ancestral Puebloan cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. Many of their pueblos, cliffside dwellings, rock paintings and other prehistoric treasures have survived and attract thousands of tourists each year. [citation needed]\n\nLa conquista del Colorado, by Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau, depicts Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado\'s 1540â€“1542 expedition. GarcÃ­a LÃ³pez de CÃ¡rdenas can be seen overlooking the Grand Canyon.\nIn 1539, Marcos de Niza, a Spanish Franciscan, became the first European to contact Native Americans. He explored parts of the present state and made contact with native inhabitants, probably the Sobaipuri. The expedition of Spanish explorer Coronado entered the area in 1540â€“1542 during its search for CÃ­bola.[24] Few Spanish settlers migrated to Arizona. One of the first settlers in Arizona was JosÃ© Romo de Vivar.[25]\nFather Kino was the next European in the region. A member of the Society of Jesus (\"Jesuits\"), he led the development of a chain of missions in the region. He converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the PimerÃ­a Alta (now southern Arizona and northern Sonora) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded presidios (\"fortified towns\") at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775.[26]\nWhen Mexico achieved its independence from the Kingdom of Spain and its Spanish Empire in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of its Territory of Nueva California, (\"New California\"), also known as Alta California (\"Upper California\").[27] Descendants of ethnic Spanish and mestizo settlers from the colonial years still lived in the area at the time of the arrival of later European-American migrants from the United States.  [citation needed]\n\nMexico in 1824. Alta California is the northwesternmost state.\nDuring the Mexicanâ€“American War (1847â€“1848), the U.S. Army occupied the national capital of Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became Arizona Territory in 1863 and later the State of Arizona in 1912.[28] The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants of former Mexican citizens being considered as inviolable, the sum of $15 million in compensation (equivalent to $528,230,769.23 in 2023) be paid to the Republic of Mexico.[29] In 1853, the U.S. acquired the land south below the Gila River from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase along the southern border area as encompassing the best future southern route for a transcontinental railway.[30]\nWhat is now the state of Arizona was administered by the United States government as part of the Territory of New Mexico from 1850 until the southern part of that region seceded from the Union to form the Territory of Arizona.[31] This newly established territory was formally organized by the federal government of the Confederate States on Saturday, January 18, 1862, when President Jefferson Davis approved and signed An Act to Organize the Territory of Arizona,[32] marking the first official use of the name \"Territory of Arizona\". The Southern territory supplied the Confederate government with men, horses, and equipment. Formed in 1862, Arizona scout companies served with the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Arizona has the westernmost military engagement on record during the Civil War with the Battle of Picacho Pass (1862).[33]\n\nGeronimo (far right) and his Apache warriors fought against both Mexican and American settlers.\nThe Federal government declared a new U.S. Arizona Territory, consisting of the western half of earlier New Mexico Territory, in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863.[34] These new boundaries would later form the basis of the state. The first territorial capital, Prescott, was founded in 1864 following a gold rush to central Arizona.[35] The capital was later moved to Tucson, back to Prescott, and then to its final location in Phoenix in a series of controversial moves as different regions of the territory gained and lost political influence with the growth and development of the territory.[36]\nAlthough names including \"Gadsonia\", \"Pimeria\", \"Montezuma\" and \"Arizuma\" had been considered for the territory,[37] when 16th President Abraham Lincoln signed the final bill, it read \"Arizona\", and that name was adopted. (Montezuma was not derived from the Aztec emperor, but was the sacred name of a divine hero to the Pima people of the Gila River Valley. It was probably considered â€“ and rejected â€“ for its sentimental value before Congress settled on the name \"Arizona\".) [citation needed]\nBrigham Young, leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City in Utah, sent Mormons to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded Mesa, Snowflake, Heber, Safford, and other towns. They also settled in the Phoenix Valley (or \"Valley of the Sun\"), Tempe, Prescott, and other areas. The Mormons settled what became northern Arizona and northern New Mexico. At the time these areas were in a part of the former New Mexico Territory.\nDuring the nineteenth century, a series of gold and silver rushes occurred in the territory, the best known being the 1870s stampede to the silver bonanzas of Tombstone, Arizona, in southeast Arizona, also known for its legendary outlaws and lawmen.[38] By the late 1880s, copper production eclipsed the precious metals with the rise of copper camps like Bisbee, Arizona, and Jerome, Arizona.[39][40] The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname \"the Copper State\" at the time of statehood.[41][42] During the first years of statehood the industry experienced growing pains and labor disputes with the Bisbee Deportation of 1917 the result of a copper miners\' strike.[43]\n\nChildren of Depression-era migrant workers, Pinal County, 1937\n20th century to present[edit]\nDuring the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920, several battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizona settlements. Throughout the revolution, many Arizonans enlisted in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. Only two significant engagements took place on U.S. soil between U.S. and Mexican forces: Pancho Villa\'s 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico and the Battle of Ambos Nogales in 1918 in Arizona.\nAfter Mexican federal troops fired on U.S. soldiers, the American garrison launched an assault into Nogales, Mexico. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle had occurred, considered the last engagement in the American Indian Wars, which lasted from 1775 to 1918. U.S. soldiers stationed on the border confronted Yaqui Indians who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico. [citation needed]\nArizona became a U.S. state on February 14, 1912, coinciding with Valentine\'s Day. Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the U.S. and the last of the contiguous states to be admitted.[44]\n\nEleanor Roosevelt at the Gila River relocation center, April 23, 1943\nCotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona\'s most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression.[45] But during the 1920s and even the 1930s, tourism began to develop as the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches, such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to take part in the flavor and activities of the \"Old West\". Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws. They include the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).[46][47]\nArizona was the site of German prisoner of war camps during World War II and Japanese American internment camps.[48] Because of wartime fears of a Japanese invasion of the U.S. West Coast (which in fact materialized in the Aleutian Islands Campaign in June 1942), from 1942 to 1945, persons of Japanese descent were forced to reside in internment camps built in the interior of the country. Many lost their homes and businesses. The camps were abolished after World War II.[49]\nThe Phoenix-area German P.O.W. site was purchased after the war by the Maytag family (of major home appliance fame). It was developed as the site of the Phoenix Zoo. A Japanese-American internment camp was on Mount Lemmon, just outside the state\'s southeastern city of Tucson. Another POW camp was near the Gila River in eastern Yuma County. Arizona was also home to the Phoenix Indian School, one of several federal Indian boarding schools designed to assimilate Native American children into mainstream European-American culture. Children were often enrolled in these schools against the wishes of their parents and families. Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair, to take and use English names, to speak only English, and to practice Christianity rather than their native religions.[50]\nNumerous Native Americans from Arizona fought for the United States during World War II. Their experiences resulted in a rising activism in the postwar years to achieve better treatment and civil rights after their return to the state. After Maricopa County did not allow them to register to vote, in 1948 veteran Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, of the Mojave-Apache Tribe at Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, brought a legal suit, Harrison and Austin v. Laveen, to challenge this exclusion. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in their favor.[51]\nArizona\'s population grew tremendously with residential and business development after World War II, aided by the widespread use of air conditioning, which made the intensely hot summers more comfortable. According to the Arizona Blue Book (published by the Arizona Secretary of State\'s office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades, and about 60% each decade thereafter. [citation needed]\nIn the 1960s, retirement communities were developed. These age-restricted subdivisions catered exclusively to the needs of senior citizens and attracted many retirees who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest and the Northeast. Sun City, established by developer Del Webb and opened in 1960, was one of the first such communities. Green Valley, south of Tucson, was another such community, designed as a retirement subdivision for Arizona\'s teachers. Many senior citizens from across the United States and Canada come to Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as snowbirds. [citation needed]\nIn March 2000, Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election ever held over the internet to nominate a candidate for public office.[52] In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary, under worldwide attention, Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley. Voter turnout in this state primary increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.\nIn the 21st century, Arizona has frequently garnered national attention for its efforts to quell illegal immigration into the state. In 2004, voters passed Proposition 200, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. The Supreme Court of the United States struck this restriction down in 2013.[53] In 2010, Arizona enacted SB 1070 which required all immigrants to carry immigration papers at all times, but the Supreme Court also invalidated parts of this law in Arizona v. United States in 2012.[54]\nOn January 8, 2011, a gunman shot congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 18 others at a gathering in Tucson. Giffords was critically wounded. The incident sparked national attention regarding incendiary political rhetoric.[55]\nThree ships named USS Arizona have been christened in honor of the state, although only USS Arizona (BB-39) was so named after statehood was achieved.\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Arizona\nKÃ¶ppen climate types of Arizona\nThe Grand Canyon\nArizona is in the Southwestern United States as one of the Four Corners states. Arizona is the sixth largest state by area, ranked after New Mexico and before Nevada. Of the state\'s 113,998 square miles (295,000 km2), approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and parkland, state trust land and Native American reservations. There are 24 National Park Service maintained sites in Arizona, including the three national parks of Grand Canyon National Park, Saguaro National Park, and the Petrified Forest National Park.[56]\nArizona is well known for its desert Basin and Range region in the state\'s southern portions, which is rich in a landscape of xerophyte plants such as the cactus. This region\'s topography was shaped by prehistoric volcanism, followed by the cooling-off and related subsidence. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests).\nLike other states of the Southwest United States, Arizona is marked by high mountains, the Colorado plateau, and mesas. Despite the state\'s aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest,[57] a percentage comparable to modern-day Romania or Greece.[58] The world\'s largest stand of ponderosa pine trees is in Arizona.[59]\nThe Mogollon Rim (/ ËŒmoÊŠ gÉ™ËˆyoÊŠn /), a 1,998-foot (609 m) escarpment, cuts across the state\'s central section and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. In 2002, this was an area of the Rodeoâ€“Chediski Fire, the worst fire in state history until 2011.\nLocated in northern Arizona, the Grand Canyon is a colorful, deep, steep-sided gorge, carved by the Colorado River. The canyon is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and is largely contained in the Grand Canyon National Park â€“ one of the first national parks in the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area as a National Park, often visiting to hunt mountain lion and enjoy the scenery. The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about 277 miles (446 km) long, ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles (6 to 29 km) and attains a depth of more than 1 mile (1.6 km). Nearly two billion years of the Earth\'s history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of sediment as the Colorado Plateau uplifted.\nArizona is home to one of the most well-preserved meteorite impact sites in the world. Created around 50,000 years ago, the Barringer Meteorite Crater (better known simply as \"Meteor Crater\") is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Winslow.[60] A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises 150 feet (46 m) above the level of the surrounding plain.

In the lower elevations the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and extremely hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of 60 Â°F (16 Â°C). November through February are the coldest months, with temperatures typically ranging from 40 to 75 Â°F (4 to 24 Â°C), with occasional frosts.[61]\nAbout midway through February, the temperatures start to rise, with warm days, and cool, breezy nights. The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat from 90 to 120 Â°F (32 to 49 Â°C), with occasional high temperatures exceeding 125 Â°F (52 Â°C) having been observed in the desert area.[61] Arizona\'s all-time record high is 128 Â°F (53 Â°C) recorded at Lake Havasu City on June 29, 1994, and July 5, 2007; the all-time record low of âˆ’40 Â°F (âˆ’40 Â°C) was recorded at Hawley Lake on January 7, 1971.[62]\nDue to the primarily dry climate, large diurnal temperature variations occur in less-developed areas of the desert above 2,500 ft (760 m). The swings can be as large as 83 Â°F (46 Â°C) in the summer months. In the state\'s urban centers, the effects of local warming result in much higher measured night-time lows than in the recent past.\nArizona has an average annual rainfall of 12.7 in (323 mm),[63] which comes during two rainy seasons, with cold fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean during the winter and a monsoon in the summer.[64] The monsoon season occurs toward the end of summer. In July or August, the dewpoint rises dramatically for a brief period. During this time, the air contains large amounts of water vapor. Dewpoints as high as 81 Â°F (27 Â°C)[65] have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season. This hot moisture brings lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause flash floods, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the Arizona Legislature enacted the Stupid Motorist Law. It is rare for tornadoes or hurricanes to occur in Arizona.\nArizona\'s northern third is a plateau at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers, though the climate remains semiarid to arid. Extremely cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below 0 Â°F (âˆ’18 Â°C) to the state\'s northern parts.[66]\nIndicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100 Â°F (38 Â°C) (Phoenix), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing (Flagstaff).[67]\n\n\nAverage daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected cities in Arizona[68]\n\n\nLocation\n\nJuly (Â°F)\n\nJuly (Â°C)\n\nDecember (Â°F)\n\nDecember (Â°C)\n\n\nPhoenix\n106/83\n41/28\n66/45\n19/7\n\n\nTucson\n100/74\n38/23\n65/39\n18/4\n\n\nYuma\n107/82\n42/28\n68/46\n20/8\n\n\nFlagstaff\n81/51\n27/11\n42/17\n6/âˆ’8\n\n\nPrescott\n89/60\n32/16\n51/23\n11/âˆ’5\n\n\nKingman\n98/66\n37/19\n56/32\n13/0\n\nCities and towns[edit]\nSee also: List of places in Arizona, List of cities and towns in Arizona, and List of Arizona counties\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Other prominent cities in the Phoenix metro area include Mesa (Arizona\'s third largest city), Chandler (Arizona\'s fourth largest city), Glendale, Peoria, Buckeye, Sun City, Sun City West, Fountain Hills, Surprise, Gilbert, El Mirage, Avondale, Tempe, Tolleson and Scottsdale, with a total metropolitan population of just over 4.7 million.[69] The average high temperature in July, 106 Â°F (41 Â°C), is one of the highest of any metropolitan area in the United States, offset by an average January high temperature of 67 Â°F (19 Â°C), the basis of its winter appeal.\nTucson, with a metro population of just over one million, is the state\'s second-largest city. Located in Pima County, approximately 110 miles (180 km) southeast of Phoenix, it was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona. It is home to the University of Arizona. Major incorporated suburbs of Tucson include Oro Valley and Marana northwest of the city, Sahuarita south of the city, and South Tucson in an enclave south of downtown. It has an average July temperature of 100 Â°F (38 Â°C) and winter temperatures averaging 65 Â°F (18 Â°C). Saguaro National Park, just west of the city in the Tucson Mountains, is the site of the world\'s largest collection of Saguaro cacti.\nThe Prescott metropolitan area includes the cities of Prescott, Cottonwood, Camp Verde and many other towns in the 8,123 square miles (21,000 km2) of Yavapai County area. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns is the state\'s third largest metropolitan area. The city of Prescott (population 41,528) lies approximately 100 miles (160 km) northwest of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Situated in pine tree forests at an elevation of about 5,500 feet (1,700 m), Prescott enjoys a much cooler climate than Phoenix, with average summer highs around 88 Â°F (31 Â°C) and winter temperatures averaging 50 Â°F (10 Â°C).\nYuma is the center of the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Arizona. Located in Yuma County, it is near the borders of California and Mexico. It is one of the hottest cities in the United States, with an average July high of 107 Â°F (42 Â°C). For comparison, the same month\'s average in Death Valley is 115 Â°F (46 Â°C). The city features sunny days about 90% of the year. The Yuma Metropolitan Statistical Area has a population of 160,000. Yuma attracts many winter visitors from all over the United States.\nFlagstaff, in Coconino County, is the largest city in northern Arizona, and is at an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet (2,100 m). With its large Ponderosa pine forests, snowy winter weather and picturesque mountains, it is a stark contrast to the desert regions typically associated with Arizona. It is sited at the base of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona, which contains Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at 12,633 feet (3,851 m). Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to numerous tourist attractions including: Grand Canyon National Park, Sedona, and Oak Creek Canyon. Historic U.S. Route 66 is the main eastâ€“west street in the town. The Flagstaff metropolitan area is home to 134,421 residents and the main campus of Northern Arizona University.\nLake Havasu City, in Mohave County, known as \"Arizona\'s playground\", was developed on the Colorado River and is named after Lake Havasu. Lake Havasu City has a population of about 57,000 people. It is famous for huge spring break parties, sunsets and the London Bridge, relocated from London, England. Lake Havasu City was founded by real estate developer Robert P. McCulloch in 1963.[70] It has two colleges, Mohave Community College and ASU Colleges in Lake Havasu City.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n   Largest cities or towns in ArizonaSource:[72]\n\n\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\n\n\nPhoenixTucson\n\n1\nPhoenix\nMaricopa\n1,624,569\n11\nGoodyear\nMaricopa\n101,733\n\nMesaChandler\n\n\n2\nTucson\nPima\n543,242\n12\nBuckeye\nMaricopa\n101,315\n\n\n3\nMesa\nMaricopa\n509,475\n13\nYuma\nYuma\n97,093\n\n\n4\nChandler\nMaricopa\n279,458\n14\nAvondale\nMaricopa\n90,564\n\n\n5\nGilbert\nMaricopa\n273,136\n15\nFlagstaff\nCoconino\n76,989\n\n\n6\nGlendale\nMaricopa\n249,630\n16\nQueen Creek\nMaricopa / Pinal\n66,346\n\n\n7\nScottsdale\nMaricopa\n242,753\n17\nMaricopa\nPinal\n62,720\n\n\n8\nPeoria\nMaricopa\n194,917\n18\nLake Havasu City\nMohave\n58,284\n\n\n9\nTempe\nMaricopa\n184,118\n19\nCasa Grande\nPinal\n57,699\n\n\n10\nSurprise\nMaricopa\n149,191\n20\nMarana\nPima\n54,895\n\n\nDemographics[edit]\nMain article: Demographics of Arizona\n\n\n\nA population density map of Arizona\n\n\n\nMap of counties in Arizona by racial plurality, per the 2020 U.S. census show Legend  Non-Hispanic White   40â€“50%   50â€“60%   60â€“70%   70â€“80% Native American   40â€“50%   70â€“80% Hispanic or Latino   60â€“70%   80â€“90%  \n\n\n\nExtent of the Spanish language in the state of Arizona\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n18606,482â€”18709,65849.0%188040,440318.7%189088,243118.2%1900122,93139.3%1910204,35466.2%1920334,16263.5%1930435,57330.3%1940499,26114.6%1950749,58750.1%19601,302,16173.7%19701,770,90036.0%19802,718,21553.5%19903,665,22834.8%20005,130,63240.0%20106,392,01724.6%20207,151,50211.9%2023 (est.)7,431,3443.9%Sources: 1910â€“2020[73]Note that early censusesmay not includeNative Americans in Arizona\n2023[74]\n\nThe United States Census Bureau records Arizona\'s population as 7,151,502 in the 2020 census,[7] a 12% increase since the 2010 United States census.[73]\nArizona remained sparsely settled for most of the 19th century.[75] The 1860 census reported the population of \"Arizona County\" to be 6,482, of whom 4,040 were listed as \"Indians\", 21 as \"free colored\", and 2,421 as \"white\".[76][77] Arizona\'s continued population growth has put an enormous stress on the state\'s water supply.[78] As of 2011[update], 61% of Arizona\'s children under age one belonged to racial groups of color.[79]\nThe population of metropolitan Phoenix increased by 45% from 1991 through 2001, helping to make Arizona the second fastest-growing state in the U.S. in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada).[80]\nAccording to the 2010 United States census, Arizona had a population of 6,392,017.

In addition, the various urban areas are served by complex networks of state routes and highways, such as the Loop 101, which is part of Phoenix\'s vast freeway system.[114]\n\nPublic transportation, Amtrak, and intercity bus[edit]\nSee also: List of passenger train stations in Arizona\nThe Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. Greyhound Lines serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.\nA light rail system, called Valley Metro Rail, was completed in December 2008; it connects Central Phoenix with the nearby cities of Mesa and Tempe.[115]\nIn Tucson, the Sun Link streetcar system travels through the downtown area, connecting the main University of Arizona campus with Mercado San Agustin on the western edge of downtown Tucson. Sun Link, loosely based on the Portland Streetcar, launched in July 2014.[116]\nAmtrak Southwest Chief route serves the northern part of the state, stopping at Winslow, Flagstaff, Williams and Kingman. The Texas Eagle and Sunset Limited routes serve South-Central Arizona, stopping at Tucson, Maricopa, Yuma and Benson. Phoenix lost Amtrak service in 1996 with the rerouting of the Sunset Limited, and now an Amtrak bus runs between Phoenix and the station in Maricopa. As of 2021, Amtrak has proposed to restore rail service between Phoenix and Tucson.[117]\n\nLaw and government[edit]\nMain article: Government of Arizona\nSee also: Arizona Constitution, United States congressional delegations from Arizona, List of Arizona Governors, Political party strength in Arizona, and Arizona Revised Statutes\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nCapitol complex[edit]\nThe original Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix\nThe capital of Arizona is Phoenix. The original Capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900) when the area was a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona\'s admission to the union in 1912.[118]\nThe House of Representatives and Senate buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.\nThe Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, named after Wesley Bolin, a governor who died in office in the 1970s. The site also includes many monuments and memorials, including the anchor and signal mast from the USS Arizona (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor) and a granite version of the Ten Commandments.\n\nState legislative branch[edit]\nThe Arizona Legislature is bicameral and consists of a thirty-member Senate and a 60-member House of Representatives. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.[119]\nEach Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns sine die (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can be extended only by a majority vote of members present of each house.\nThe majority party is the Republican Party, which has held power in both houses since 1993. The Democratic Party picked up several legislative seats in recent elections, bringing both chambers one seat away from being equally divided as of 2021.[120]\nArizona state senators and representatives are elected for two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is common for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.\n\nState executive branch[edit]\n\n\nState of Arizonaelected officials\n\n\nGovernor\n\nKatie Hobbs (D)\n\n\nSecretary of State\n\nAdrian Fontes (D)\n\n\nAttorney General\n\nKris Mayes (D)\n\n\nState Treasurer\n\nKimberly Yee (R)\n\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction\n\nTom Horne (R)\n\n\nState Mine Inspector\n\nPaul Marsh (R)\n\n\nCorporation Commissioner\n\n\nNick Myers (R)\nJames O\'Connor (R)\nLea MÃ¡rquez Peterson (R)\nAnna Tovar (D)\nKevin Thompson (R)\n\n\nSpeaker of the House\n\n\nBen Toma (R)\n\n\n\nPresident of the Senate\n\n\nWarren Petersen (R)\n\n\n\nArizona\'s executive branch is headed by a governor, who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that has no governor\'s mansion. During their term, the governors reside within their private residence, with executive offices housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The governor of Arizona is Katie Hobbs (D).\nGovernor Jan Brewer assumed office in 2009 after Janet Napolitano had her nomination by Barack Obama for Secretary of Homeland Security confirmed by the Senate.[121] Arizona has had four female governors and a fifth currently serving, more than any other state.\nOther elected executive officials include the Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Attorney General, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Mine Inspector, and a five-member Corporation Commission. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the State Mine Inspector, which is limited to four terms).[122]\nArizona is one of five states that do not have a lieutenant governor. The elected secretary of state is first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. If appointed, the Secretary of State is not eligible and the next governor is selected from the next eligible official in the line of succession, including the attorney general, state treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have succeeded to the state\'s governorship.\nOn November 8, 2022, Arizona voters approved a state constitutional amendment (Proposition 131) that created the position and office of the lieutenant governor beginning with the 2026 elections. The position will be elected on a joint ticket with the governor. The lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship if the incumbent governor dies, resigns, or is removed (via impeachment conviction) from office. The proposition, through a law pre-passed by the state legislature, also tasks the governor with assigning a job to her or his running mate, such as chief of staff, the director of the state Department of Administration, or \"any position\" to which the governor can appoint someone by law.[123]\n\nState judicial branch[edit]\nThe Arizona Supreme Court is the highest court in Arizona, consisting of a chief justice, a vice chief justice, and five associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission and must be sustained in office by election after the first two years following their appointment. Subsequent sustaining elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but nearly all other appellate cases go through the Arizona Court of Appeals first. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals, subdivided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of nineteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of nine judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.\nEach county of Arizona has a superior court, the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.\n\nCounties[edit]\nArt Deco doors of the Cochise County Courthouse in Bisbee\nArizona is divided into 15 counties, ranging in size from 1,238 square miles (3,210 km2) to 18,661 square miles (48,330 km2).\n\n\n\nhideArizona counties\n\nCounty name\nCounty seat\nFounded\n2020 population[124]\nPercent of total\nArea (sq mi)\nPercent of total\n\n\nApache\nSt. Johns\nFebruary 24, 1879\n66,021\n0.9%\n11,218\n9.8%\n\n\nCochise\nBisbee\nFebruary 1, 1881\n125,447\n1.8%\n6,219\n5.5%\n\n\nCoconino\nFlagstaff\nFebruary 18, 1891\n145,101\n2.0%\n18,661\n16.4%\n\n\nGila\nGlobe\nFebruary 8, 1881\n53,272\n0.7%\n4,796\n4.2%\n\n\nGraham\nSafford\nMarch 10, 1881\n38,533\n0.5%\n4,641\n4.1%\n\n\nGreenlee\nClifton\nMarch 10, 1909\n9,563\n0.1%\n1,848\n1.6%\n\n\nLa Paz\nParker\nJanuary 1, 1983\n16,557\n0.2%\n4,513\n4.0%\n\n\nMaricopa\nPhoenix\nFebruary 14, 1871\n4,420,568\n61.8%\n9,224\n8.1%\n\n\nMohave\nKingman\nNovember 9, 1864\n213,267\n3.0%\n13,470\n11.8%\n\n\nNavajo\nHolbrook\nMarch 21, 1895\n106,717\n1.5%\n9,959\n8.7%\n\n\nPima\nTucson\nNovember 9, 1864\n1,043,433\n14.6%\n9,189\n8.1%\n\n\nPinal\nFlorence\nFebruary 1, 1875\n425,264\n6.0%\n5,374\n4.7%\n\n\nSanta Cruz\nNogales\nMarch 15, 1899\n47,669\n0.7%\n1,238\n1.1%\n\n\nYavapai\nPrescott\nNovember 9, 1864\n236,209\n3.3%\n8,128\n7.1%\n\n\nYuma\nYuma\nNovember 9, 1864\n203,881\n2.9%\n5,519\n4.8%\n\n\nTotals: 15\n\n\n\n7,151,502\n\n\n\n113,997\n\n\n\nFederal representation[edit]\nArizona\'s two United States Senators are Kyrsten Sinema (I) and Mark Kelly (D).\nArizona\'s United States Representatives are David Schweikert (R-1), Eli Crane (R-2), Ruben Gallego (D-3), Greg Stanton (D-4), Andy Biggs (R-5), Juan Ciscomani (R-6), Raul Grijalva (D-7), Debbie Lesko (R-8), and Paul Gosar (R-9).

During this time, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, the only exceptions being the elections of 1920, 1924 and 1928 â€“ all three were national Republican landslides.\nIn 1924, Congress had passed a law granting citizenship and suffrage to all Native Americans, some of whom had previously been excluded as members of tribes on reservations. Legal interpretations of Arizona\'s constitution prohibited Native Americans living on reservations from voting, classifying them as being under \"guardianship\".[51] This interpretation was overturned as being incorrect and unconstitutional in 1948 by the Arizona Supreme Court, following a lawsuit by World War II Indian veterans Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, both of the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation. The landmark case is Harrison and Austin v. Laveen. After the men were refused the opportunity to register in Maricopa County, they filed lawsuit against the registrar. The National Congress of American Indians, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and the American Civil Liberties Union all filed amicus curiae (friends of the court) briefs in the case. The State Supreme Court established the rights of Native Americans to vote in the state; at the time, they comprised about 11% of the population.[51] That year, a similar provision was overturned in New Mexico when challenged by another Indian veteran in court. These were the only two states that had continued to prohibit Native Americans from voting.[126][51]\nArizona voted Republican in every presidential election from 1952 to 1992, with Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan winning the state by particularly large margins. During this forty-year span, it was the only state not to be carried by a Democrat at least once.\n\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Arizona[127]\nhide\n\nYear\n\nRepublican\n\nDemocratic\n\nThird party\n\nNo.â€¯\n%\nNo.â€¯\n%\nNo.â€¯\n%\n\n\n2020\n\n1,661,686\n\n48.91%\n\n1,672,143\n\n49.22%\n\n63,559\n\n1.87%\n\n\n2016\n\n1,252,401\n\n48.08%\n\n1,161,167\n\n44.58%\n\n191,089\n\n7.34%\n\n\n2012\n\n1,233,654\n\n53.48%\n\n1,025,232\n\n44.45%\n\n47,673\n\n2.07%\n\n\n2008\n\n1,230,111\n\n53.39%\n\n1,034,707\n\n44.91%\n\n39,020\n\n1.69%\n\n\n2004\n\n1,104,294\n\n54.77%\n\n893,524\n\n44.32%\n\n18,284\n\n0.91%\n\n\n2000\n\n781,652\n\n50.95%\n\n685,341\n\n44.67%\n\n67,120\n\n4.38%\n\n\n1996\n\n622,073\n\n44.29%\n\n653,288\n\n46.52%\n\n129,044\n\n9.19%\n\n\n1992\n\n572,086\n\n38.47%\n\n543,050\n\n36.52%\n\n371,870\n\n25.01%\n\n\n1988\n\n702,541\n\n59.95%\n\n454,029\n\n38.74%\n\n15,303\n\n1.31%\n\n\n1984\n\n681,416\n\n66.42%\n\n333,854\n\n32.54%\n\n10,627\n\n1.04%\n\n\n1980\n\n529,688\n\n60.61%\n\n246,843\n\n28.24%\n\n97,414\n\n11.15%\n\n\n1976\n\n418,642\n\n56.37%\n\n295,602\n\n39.80%\n\n28,475\n\n3.83%\n\n\n1972\n\n402,812\n\n61.64%\n\n198,540\n\n30.38%\n\n52,153\n\n7.98%\n\n\n1968\n\n266,721\n\n54.78%\n\n170,514\n\n35.02%\n\n49,701\n\n10.21%\n\n\n1964\n\n242,535\n\n50.45%\n\n237,753\n\n49.45%\n\n482\n\n0.10%\n\n\n1960\n\n221,241\n\n55.52%\n\n176,781\n\n44.36%\n\n469\n\n0.12%\n\n\n1956\n\n176,990\n\n60.99%\n\n112,880\n\n38.90%\n\n303\n\n0.10%\n\n\n1952\n\n152,042\n\n58.35%\n\n108,528\n\n41.65%\n\n0\n\n0.00%\n\n\n1948\n\n77,597\n\n43.82%\n\n95,251\n\n53.79%\n\n4,217\n\n2.38%\n\n\n1944\n\n56,287\n\n40.90%\n\n80,926\n\n58.80%\n\n421\n\n0.31%\n\n\n1940\n\n54,030\n\n36.01%\n\n95,267\n\n63.49%\n\n742\n\n0.49%\n\n\n1936\n\n33,433\n\n26.93%\n\n86,722\n\n69.85%\n\n4,008\n\n3.23%\n\n\n1932\n\n36,104\n\n30.53%\n\n79,264\n\n67.03%\n\n2,883\n\n2.44%\n\n\n1928\n\n52,533\n\n57.57%\n\n38,537\n\n42.23%\n\n184\n\n0.20%\n\n\n1924\n\n30,516\n\n41.26%\n\n26,235\n\n35.47%\n\n17,210\n\n23.27%\n\n\n1920\n\n37,016\n\n55.61%\n\n29,546\n\n44.39%\n\n0\n\n0.00%\n\n\n1916\n\n20,524\n\n35.37%\n\n33,170\n\n57.17%\n\n4,327\n\n7.46%\n\n\n1912\n\n3,021\n\n12.74%\n\n10,324\n\n43.52%\n\n10,377\n\n43.74%\n\n\nDemocrat Lyndon Johnson, in 1964, lost the state by fewer than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native Barry Goldwater. (This was the most closely contested state in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Johnson that year.) Democrat Bill Clinton ended this streak in 1996, when he won Arizona by a little over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona\'s electoral votes in 1992). From 2000 until 2016, the majority of the state continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins. In the 2020 United States presidential election, Joe Biden again broke the streak by becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since 1996.[128]\nSince the mid 20th century, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became reliably Republican areas from the 1950s onward. During this time, many \"Pinto Democrats\", or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections. Two of the last six governors have been Democrats.\nOn March 4, 2008, Senator John McCain effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first major party presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.\nArizona politics is dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, Maricopa and Pima â€“ home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state\'s population and cast almost 80 percent of the state\'s vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.\nMaricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state\'s population, and most of the state\'s elected officials live there. Before Joe Biden won Maricopa County in 2020, it had voted Republican in every presidential election since 1952. This includes the 1964 run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state without his 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, aided by his 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.\nIn contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically voted more Democratic. While Tucson\'s suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.\n\nArizona teacher\'s strike and rally on April 26, 2018\nArizona rejected a same-sex marriage ban in a referendum as part of the 2006 elections.

Same-sex marriage was not recognized in Arizona, but this amendment would have denied any legal or financial benefits to unmarried homosexual or heterosexual couples.[129] In 2008, Arizona voters passed Proposition 102, an amendment to the state constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. It passed by a more narrow majority than similar votes in a number of other states.[130]\nIn 2010, Arizona adopted SB 1070, called the \"toughest immigration law\" in the United States. A fierce debate erupted between supporters and detractors of SB 1070.[131] The United States Supreme Court struck down portions of the Arizona law, which required all immigrants to carry immigration papers at all times, in Arizona v. United States.[132]\nThe West Virginia teachers\' strike in 2018 inspired teachers in other states, including Arizona, to take similar action.[133]\nArizona retains the death penalty. There is currently a gubernatorial hold on executions. Authorized methods of execution include the gas chamber.[134]\n\nSame-sex marriage and civil unions[edit]\nIn 2006, Arizona became the first state in the United States to reject a proposition, Prop 107, that would have banned same-sex marriage and civil unions.[135] However, in 2008, Arizona voters approved of Prop 102, a constitutional amendment that prohibited same-sex marriage but not other unions.[136] Prior to same-sex marriage being legal, the City of Bisbee became the first jurisdiction in Arizona to approve of civil unions.[137] The state\'s Attorney General at the time, Tom Horne, threatened to sue, but rescinded the threat once Bisbee amended the ordinance; Bisbee approved of civil unions in 2013.[138] The municipalities of Clarkdale, Cottonwood, Jerome, Sedona, and Tucson also passed civil unions.[139]\nA November 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found 44% of Arizona voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56â€“43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[140]\nOn October 17, 2014, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced his office would no longer object to same-sex marriage, in response to a U.S. District Court Ruling on Arizona Proposition 102. On that day, each county\'s Clerk of the Superior Court began to issue same-sex marriage licenses, and Arizona became the 31st state to legalize same-sex marriage.[141]\nThe 2023 American Values Atlas by Public Religion Research Institute found that an overwhelming majority of residents support same-sex marriage.[142]\n\nEducation[edit]\nElementary and secondary education[edit]\nPublic schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the Arizona State Board of Education and the Arizona Department of Education. A state Superintendent of Public Instruction (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.[143]\n\nHigher education[edit]\nThe University of Arizona (the Mall) in Tucson\nArizona State University (a biodesign building) in Tempe\nNorthern Arizona University (The Skydome) in Flagstaff\nArizona is served by three public universities: The University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Northern Arizona University. These schools are governed by the Arizona Board of Regents.\nPrivate higher education in Arizona is dominated by a large number of for-profit and \"chain\" (multi-site) universities.[144]\nEmbryâ€“Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott and Prescott College are Arizona\'s only non-profit four-year private colleges.[145]\nArizona has a wide network of two-year vocational schools and community colleges. These colleges were governed historically by a separate statewide board of directors but, in 2002, the state legislature transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.[146] The Maricopa County Community College District includes 11 community colleges throughout Maricopa County and is one of the largest in the nation.\n\nPublic universities in Arizona[edit]\nArizona State University, (Sun Devils) Tempe/Phoenix/Mesa/Glendale/Lake Havasu\nNorthern Arizona University, (Lumberjacks) Flagstaff/Yuma/Prescott\nUniversity of Arizona, (Wildcats) Tucson/Sierra Vista, MD college in downtown Phoenix and UA Agricultural Center in Yuma/Maricopa\nPrivate colleges and universities in Arizona[edit]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of colleges and universities in Arizona.\n\nAmerican Indian College\nCarrington College\nArizona Christian University\nArt Center College of Design\nArt Institute of Tucson\nArt Institute of Phoenix\nA.T.

The museum displays international exhibitions alongside the museum\'s collection of more than 18,000 works of American, Asian, European, Latin American, Western American, modern and contemporary art, and fashion design. With a community education mandate since 1951, Phoenix Art Museum holds a year-round program of festivals, live performances, independent art films and educational programs. The museum also has PhxArtKids, an interactive space for children; photography exhibitions through the museum\'s partnership with the Center for Creative Photography; the landscaped Sculpture Garden and dining at Arcadia Farms.[148]\nArizona is a recognized center of Native American art, with a number of galleries showcasing historical and contemporary works. The Heard Museum, also in Phoenix, is a major repository of Native American art. Some of the signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection containing 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, and an exhibit on the 19th-century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum has about 250,000 visitors a year.\nSedona, Jerome, and Tubac are known as budding artist colonies, and small arts scenes exist in the larger cities and near the state universities.[149]\n\nFilm[edit]\nSee also: List of films shot in Arizona\nView of Monument Valley from John Ford\'s Point\nSeveral major Hollywood films, such as Billy Jack, U Turn, Waiting to Exhale, Just One of the Guys, Can\'t Buy Me Love, Bill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure, The Scorpion King, The Banger Sisters, Used Cars, and Raising Arizona have been made there (as have many Westerns). The 1993 science fiction movie Fire in the Sky, based on a reported alien abduction in the town of Snowflake, was set in Snowflake. It was filmed in the Oregon towns of Oakland, Roseburg, and Sutherlin.\nThe 1974 film Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore, for which Ellen Burstyn won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and also starring Kris Kristofferson, was set in Tucson. The climax of the 1977 Clint Eastwood film The Gauntlet takes place in downtown Phoenix. The final segments of the 1984 film Starman take place at Meteor Crater outside Winslow. The Jeff Foxworthy comedy documentary movie Blue Collar Comedy Tour was filmed almost entirely at the Dodge Theatre. Some of Alfred Hitchcock\'s classic film Psycho was shot in Phoenix, the ostensible home town of the main character.\nSome of the television shows filmed or set in Arizona include The New Dick Van Dyke Show, Medium, Alice, The First 48, Insomniac with Dave Attell, Cops, and America\'s Most Wanted. The TV sitcom Alice, which was based on the movie was set in Phoenix. Twilight had passages set in Phoenix at the beginning and the end of the film.\n\nMusic[edit]\nMain article: Music of Arizona\nArizona is prominently featured in the lyrics of many Country and Western songs, such as Jamie O\'Neal\'s hit ballad \"There Is No Arizona\". George Strait\'s \"Oceanfront Property\" uses \"ocean front property in Arizona\" as a metaphor for a sucker proposition. The line \"see you down in Arizona Bay\" is used in a Tool song in reference to the possibility (expressed as a hope by comedian Bill Hicks) that Southern California will one day fall into the ocean. Glen Campbell, a notable resident, popularized the song \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\".\n\nStandin\' on the Corner Park and mural in Winslow, Arizona\n\"Arizona\" was the title of a popular song recorded by Mark Lindsay. Arizona is mentioned by the hit song \"Take It Easy\", written by Jackson Browne and Glenn Frey and performed by the Eagles. Arizona is also mentioned in the Beatles\' song \"Get Back\", credited to John Lennon and Paul McCartney; McCartney sings: \"JoJo left his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some California grass.\" \"Carefree Highway\", released in 1974 by Gordon Lightfoot, takes its name from Arizona State Route 74 north of Phoenix.[150]\nArizona\'s budding music scene is helped by emerging bands, as well as some well-known artists. The Gin Blossoms, Chronic Future, Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers, Jimmy Eat World, Caroline\'s Spine, and others began their careers in Arizona. Also, a number of punk and rock bands got their start in Arizona, including JFA, The Feederz, Sun City Girls, The Meat Puppets, The Maine, The Summer Set, and more recently Authority Zero and Digital Summer.\nArizona also has many singers and other musicians. Singer, songwriter and guitarist Michelle Branch is from Sedona. Chester Bennington, the former lead vocalist of Linkin Park, and mash-up artist DJ Z-Trip are both from Phoenix. One of Arizona\'s better known musicians is shock rocker Alice Cooper, who helped define the genre. Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of the bands Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Puscifer, calls the town of Cornville home.\nOther notable singers include country singers Dierks Bentley and Marty Robbins, folk singer Katie Lee, Fleetwood Mac\'s Stevie Nicks, CeCe Peniston, Rex Allen, 2007 American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, and Linda Ronstadt.\nArizona is also known for its heavy metal scene, which is centered in and around Phoenix. In the early to mid-1990s, it included bands such as Job for a Cowboy, Knights of the Abyss, Greeley Estates, Eyes Set To Kill, blessthefall, The Word Alive, The Dead Rabbitts, and Abigail Williams. The band Soulfly calls Phoenix home and Megadeth lived in Phoenix for about a decade. Beginning in and around 2009, Phoenix began to host a burgeoning desert rock and sludge metal underground, (ala\' Kyuss in 1990s California) led by bands like Wolves of Winter, Asimov, and Dead Canyon.\nAmerican composer Elliott Carter composed his first String Quartet (1950â€“51) while on sabbatical (from New York) in Arizona. The quartet won a Pulitzer Prize and other awards and is now a staple of the string quartet repertoire.[citation needed]\n\nSports[edit]\nMain article: Sports in Arizona\n\n\nClub\n\nSport\n\nLeague\n\nChampionships\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nAmerican football\n\nNational Football League\n\n2 (1925, 1947)\n\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\n1 (2001)\n\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nBasketball\n\nNational Basketball Association\n\n0\n\n\nPhoenix Mercury\n\nBasketball\n\nWomen\'s National Basketball Association\n\n3 (2007, 2009, 2014)\n\n\nPhoenix Rising FC\n\nSoccer\n\nUSL Championship\n\n1 (2023)\n\n\nTucson Roadrunners\n\nIce hockey\n\nAmerican Hockey League\n\n0\n\n\nArizona Rattlers\n\nIndoor football\n\nIndoor Football League\n\n6 (1994, 1997, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017)\n\nState Farm Stadium in Glendale\nFour Super Bowls have been held in Arizona, including Super Bowl LVII which was held at State Farm Stadium on February 12, 2023.[151]\nDue to its numerous golf courses, Arizona is home to several stops on the PGA Tour, most notably the Phoenix Open, held at the TPC of Scottsdale, and the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Marana.[152]\nAuto racing is another sport known in the state. Phoenix Raceway in Avondale is home to NASCAR race weekends twice a year. Firebird International Raceway near Chandler is home to drag racing and other motorsport events.[153]\n\nCollege sports[edit]\nCollege sports are also prevalent in Arizona. The Arizona State Sun Devils and the Arizona Wildcats belong to the Pac-12 Conference while the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks compete in the Big Sky Conference and the Grand Canyon Antelopes compete in the Western Athletic Conference. The rivalry between Arizona State Sun Devils and the Arizona Wildcats predates Arizona\'s statehood, and is the oldest rivalry in the NCAA.[154] The Territorial Cup, first awarded in 1889 and certified as the oldest trophy in college football,[155] is awarded to the winner of the annual football game between the two schools.\nArizona also hosts several college football bowl games. The Fiesta Bowl, originally held at Sun Devil Stadium, is now held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale. The Fiesta Bowl is part of the new College Football Playoff (CFP). University of Phoenix Stadium was also home to the 2007 and 2011 BCS National Championship Games.\n\nA spring training game between the Cubs and White Sox at HoHoKam Park\nState Farm Stadium hosted the Final Four of the NCAA Division I men\'s basketball tournament in 2017 and is scheduled to host it again in 2024.[156]\n\nBaseball[edit]\nArizona is a popular location for Major League Baseball spring training, as it is the site of the Cactus League. Spring training was first started in Arizona in 1947, when Brewers owner Veeck sold them in 1945 but went on to purchase the Cleveland Indians in 1946. He decided to train the Cleveland Indians in Tucson and convinced the New York Giants to give Phoenix a try. Thus, the Cactus League was born.[157]\nOn March 9, 1995, Arizona was awarded a franchise to begin to play for the 1998 season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.\nSince their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five National League West titles, two National League Championship pennants, and the 2001 World Series.[158][159]\n\nNotable people[edit]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of people from Arizona.\nSee also[edit]\n\nArizona portal\nOutline of Arizona\nIndex of Arizona-related articles\nUSS Arizona, 4 ships\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n^ second to Nevada with 9% in 2010\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n^ In 2000, this designation was broken into two groups: Independent, Non-Charismatic Churches (34,130 adherents) and Independent, Charismatic Churches (29,755 adherents)\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Grand canyon state\". statesymbolusa.

It borders the Gulf of Mexico to the west, Alabama to the northwest, Georgia to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. With a population of over 21 million, it is the third-most populous state in the United States, the most populous among the easterly states, and ranks eighth in population density as of 2020. It spans 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), ranking 22nd in area among the 50 states. The Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, is the state\'s largest metropolitan area with a population of 6.138 million, and the state\'s most-populous city is Jacksonville with a population of 949,611. Florida\'s other major population centers include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee.\nVarious American Indian tribes have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La Florida (land of flowers) ([la floËˆÉ¾iÃ°a]) for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the settlement of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was a Spanish territory frequently attacked and coveted by Great Britain before Spain ceded it to the U.S. in 1819 in exchange for resolving the border dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas. Florida was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845, and was the principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816â€“1858), the longest and most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. The state seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War on June 25, 1868.\nSince the mid-20th century, Florida has experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. Its economy, with a gross state product (GSP) of $1.4 trillion, is the fourth-largest of any U.S. state and the 16th-largest in the world; the main sectors are tourism, hospitality, agriculture, real estate, and transportation. Florida is world-renowned for its beach resorts, amusement parks, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as Walt Disney World, the Kennedy Space Center, and Miami Beach draw tens of millions of visitors annually. Florida is a popular destination for retirees, seasonal vacationers, and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. The state\'s close proximity to the ocean has shaped its culture, identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in African, European, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian influences. Florida has attracted or inspired some of the most prominent American writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, especially in golf, tennis, auto racing, and water sports. Florida has been considered a battleground state in American presidential elections, particularly those in 2000 and 2016.\nAbout two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), not including its many barrier islands. Florida has 4,510 islands that are ten acres (4.0 hectares) or larger in area, the second-largest of any state after Alaska. Much of Florida is at or near sea level, and is characterized by sedimentary soil. Florida is the flattest state in the country, with the lowest high point of any U.S. state, at just 345 feet (105 meters).\nFlorida\'s climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. It is the only state besides Hawaii to have a tropical climate, and is the only continental state with both a tropical climate, located at the southern portion of the state, and a coral reef. Florida has several unique ecosystems, including Everglades National Park, the largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the Americas. Unique wildlife include the American alligator, American crocodile, American flamingo, Roseate spoonbill, Florida panther, bottlenose dolphin, and manatee. The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world, after the Great Barrier Reef and the Belize Barrier Reef.\n\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Florida\nPaleo-Indians entered Florida at least 14,000 years ago.[12] By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major groups of people living in Florida included the Apalachee of the Florida Panhandle, the Timucua of northern and central Florida, the Ais of the central Atlantic coast, and the Calusa of southwest Florida.[13]\n\nEuropean arrival\nMain articles: New Spain, Spanish Florida, French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), West Florida, East Florida, Indian Reserve (1763), American Revolutionary War, Gulf Coast campaign, Treaty of Paris (1783), and Spanish West Florida\nMap of Florida, likely based on the expeditions of Hernando de Soto (1539â€“1543).\nThe Castillo de San Marcos. Originally white with red corners, its design reflects the colors and shapes of the Cross of Burgundy and the subsequent Flag of Florida.\nEast Florida and West Florida in British period (1763â€“1783)\nFlorida was the first region of what is now the contiguous United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n. Ponce de LeÃ³n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named it La Florida in recognition of the flowery, verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called Pascua Florida (Festival of Flowers). The following day they came ashore to seek information and take possession of this new land.[14][15] The story that he was searching for the Fountain of Youth is mythical and appeared only long after his death.[16]\nIn May 1539, Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as 70 feet (21 m), with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult.[17] The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Castilian language, and more to Florida.[18] Spain established several settlements in Florida, with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don TristÃ¡n de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making it one of the firsts settlements in Florida, but it was mostly abandoned by 1561.\nIn 1564â€“1565, there was a French settlement at Fort Caroline, in present Duval County, which was destroyed by the Spanish.[19] Today a reconstructed version of the fort stands in its location within Jacksonville.\nIn 1565, the settlement of St. Augustine (San AgustÃ­n) was established under the leadership of admiral and governor Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s, creating what would become the oldest, continuously occupied European settlements in the continental U.S. and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the Government of Florida.[20]  Spain maintained strategic control over the region by converting the local tribes to Christianity. The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville, and Miguel RodrÃ­guez, a white Segovian, occurred in 1565 in St. Augustine. It is the first recorded Christian marriage in the continental United States.[21]\nSome Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek, or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattoes. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the Thirteen Colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. King Charles II of Spain issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around St. Augustine, but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spanish Florida as early as 1683.[22]\nThe geographical area of Spanish claims in La Florida diminished with the establishment of English settlements to the north and French claims to the west. English colonists and buccaneers launched several attacks on St. Augustine in the 17th and 18th centuries, razing the city and its cathedral to the ground several times. Spain built the Castillo de San Marcos in 1672 and Fort Matanzas in 1742 to defend Florida\'s capital city from attacks, and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the Captaincy General of Cuba and the Spanish West Indies.\nIn 1738, the Spanish governor of Florida Manuel de Montiano established Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose near St. Augustine, a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the Florida militia, and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America.[23][24]\nIn 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years\' War. The trade was done as part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years\' War. Spain was granted Louisiana from France due to their loss of Florida. A large portion of the Florida population left, taking along large portions of the remaining Indigenous population with them to Cuba.[25] The British soon constructed the King\'s Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point called Wacca Pilatka, now the core of Downtown Jacksonville, and formerly referred to by the British name \"Cow Ford\", reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.[26][27][28]\nThe British divided and consolidated the Florida provinces (Las Floridas) into East Florida and West Florida, a division the Spanish government kept after the brief British period.[29] The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to Florida, reports of its natural wealth were published in England. A number of British settlers who were described as being \"energetic and of good character\" moved to Florida, mostly coming from South Carolina, Georgia and England. There was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of Bermuda. This was the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now Duval County, Baker County, St. Johns County and Nassau County. The British constructed good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits, as well as the export of lumber.[30][31]\nThe British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas, and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This was the first introduction of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today, including trial by jury, habeas corpus and county-based government.[30][31] Neither East Florida nor West Florida sent any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence. Florida remained a Loyalist stronghold for the duration of the American Revolution.[32]\nSpain regained both East and West Florida after Britain\'s defeat in the Revolutionary War and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821.[33]\n\nStatehood and Indian removal\nSee also: Republic of East Florida, Seminole Wars, Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty, Florida Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\nA Cracker cowboy, by Frederic Remington (1861â€“1909)\nDefense of Florida\'s northern border with the United States was minor during the second Spanish period. The region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for Indian attacks against U.S. territories, and the U.S. pressed Spain for reform.\nAmericans of English and Scots-Irish descent began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South Carolina. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities and the Floridan government, they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to immigrate into Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present British settlers who had remained in Florida since the British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as Florida Crackers.[34]\nThese American settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored Spanish authorities. The British settlers who had remained also resented Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent Republic of West Florida on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the garrison at Baton Rouge (now in Louisiana), and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would later become known as the \"Bonnie Blue Flag\".\nIn 1810, parts of West Florida were annexed by the proclamation of President James Madison, who claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase. These parts were incorporated into the newly formed Territory of Orleans. The U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Spain continued to dispute the area, though the United States gradually increased the area it occupied. In 1812, a group of settlers from Georgia, with de facto support from the U.S. federal government, attempted to overthrow the Floridan government in the province of East Florida. The settlers hoped to convince Floridians to join their cause and proclaim independence from Spain, but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813.[35]\nTraditionally, historians argued that Seminoles based in East Florida began raiding Georgia settlements, and offering havens for runaway slaves. The United States Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817â€“1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War. The United States now effectively controlled East Florida. Control was necessary according to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams because Florida had become \"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\"[36]\n\nA U.S. Marine boat searching the Everglades for Seminoles (hiding in foreground) during the Second Seminole War.\nMore recent historians describe that after U.S. independence, settlers in Georgia increased pressure on Seminole lands, and skirmishes near the border led to the First Seminole War (1816â€“19). The United States purchased Florida from Spain by the Adams-Onis Treaty (1819) and took possession in 1821. The Seminole were moved out of their rich farmland in northern Florida and confined to a large reservation in the interior of the Florida peninsula by the Treaty of Moultrie Creek (1823). Passage of the Indian Removal Act (1830) led to the Treaty of Payne\'s Landing (1832), which called for the relocation of all Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).[37] Some resisted, leading to the Second Seminole War, the bloodiest war against Native Americans in United States history. By 1842, most Seminoles and Black Seminoles, facing starvation, were removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Perhaps fewer than 200 Seminoles remained in Florida after the Third Seminole War (1855â€“1858), having taken refuge in the Everglades, from where they never surrendered to the US. They fostered a resurgence in traditional customs and a culture of staunch independence.[38]\nFlorida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or troops due to the devastation caused by the Peninsular War. Madrid, therefore, decided to cede the territory to the United States through the Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty, which took effect in 1821.[39] President James Monroe was authorized on March 3, 1821, to take possession of East Florida and West Florida for the United States and provide for initial governance.[40] On behalf of the U.S. government, Andrew Jackson, whom Jacksonville is named after, served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory for a brief period.[41] On March 30, 1822, the U.S. Congress merged East Florida and part of West Florida into the Florida Territory.[42]\nBy the early 1800s, Indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern U.S. and also in Florida. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the U.S. government to remove the Indians from Florida. Seminoles offered sanctuary to blacks, and these became known as the Black Seminoles, and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, the Treaty of Payne\'s Landing promised to the Seminoles lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida. Many Seminole left at this time.\nSome Seminoles remained, and the U.S. Army arrived in Florida, leading to the Second Seminole War (1835â€“1842). Following the war, approximately 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to Indian Territory. A few hundred Seminole remained in Florida in the Everglades.\n\nThe Historic Call-Collins House, the Grove, built by slaves in the 1840s, is an antebellum plantation house in Tallahassee.1840 advertisement in the Pensacola Gazette offering a $10 ($330 in 2022) reward for the return of a fugitive slave.\nOn March 3, 1845, only one day before the end of President John Tyler\'s term in office, Florida became the 27th state,[43] admitted as a slave state and no longer a sanctuary for runaway slaves. Initially its population grew slowly.[44]\nAs European settlers continued to encroach on Seminole lands, the United States intervened to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The Third Seminole War (1855â€“58) resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining Seminoles, although hundreds of Seminole Indians remained in the Everglades.[45]\nThe first settlements and towns in South Florida were founded much later than those in the northern part of the state. The first permanent European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. People came from the Bahamas to South Florida and the Keys to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous Great Florida Reef. Some accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the Seminole Indians arrived, along with a group of runaway slaves. The area was affected by the Second Seminole War, during which Major William S. Harney led several raids against the Indians. Most non-Indian residents were soldiers stationed at Fort Dallas. It was the most devastating Indian war in American history, causing almost a total loss of population in Miami.\nAfter the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, William English re-established a plantation started by his uncle on the Miami River. He charted the \"Village of Miami\" on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later a census reported there were ninety-six residents in the area.[46] The Third Seminole War was not as destructive as the second, but it slowed the settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed.\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction\nMain article: Florida in the American Civil War\nSee also: American Civil War and Reconstruction eraThe Battle of Olustee during the American Civil War, 1864\nAmerican settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market. By 1860, Florida had only 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved. There were fewer than 1,000 free African Americans before the American Civil War.[47]\nOn January 10, 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida Legislature approved an ordinance of secession,[48][49] declaring Florida to be \"a sovereign and independent nation\"â€”an apparent reassertion to the preamble in Florida\'s Constitution of 1838, in which Florida agreed with Congress to be a \"Free and Independent State\". The ordinance declared Florida\'s secession from the Union, allowing it to become one of the founding members of the Confederate States.\nThe Confederacy received little military help from Florida; the 15,000 troops it offered were generally sent elsewhere. Instead of troops and manufactured goods, Florida did provide salt and, more importantly, beef to feed the Confederate armies. This was particularly important after 1864, when the Confederacy lost control of the Mississippi River, thereby losing access to Texas beef.[50][51] The largest engagements in the state were the Battle of Olustee, on February 20, 1864, and the Battle of Natural Bridge, on March 6, 1865. Both were Confederate victories.[52] The war ended in 1865.\nFollowing the American Civil War, Florida\'s congressional representation was restored on June 25, 1868, albeit forcefully after Reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders. After the Reconstruction period ended in 1876, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature. In 1885, they created a new constitution, followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites.[53]\nIn the pre-automobile era, railroads played a key role in the state\'s development, particularly in coastal areas. In 1883, the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad connected Pensacola and the rest of the Panhandle to the rest of the state. In 1884 the South Florida Railroad (later absorbed by Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) opened full service to Tampa. In 1894 the Florida East Coast Railway reached West Palm Beach; in 1896 it reached Biscayne Bay near Miami. Numerous other railroads were built all over the interior of the state.\n\n20th and 21st century\nVacationers at the newly opened Don Cesar Hotel in St. Pete Beach, Florida in 1928.\nHistorically, Florida\'s economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as citrus fruits, strawberries, nuts, sugarcane and cattle.[54] The boll weevil devastated cotton crops during the early 20th century.[55][56]\nUntil the mid-20th century, Florida was the least-populous state in the southern United States. In 1900, its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War.[57] Forty thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population levels in Florida, left the state in the Great Migration. They left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities in the North and the West.[58] Disfranchisement for most African Americans in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage.\n\nWhite segregationists (foreground) trying to prevent black people from swimming at a \"White only\" beach in St. Augustine during the 1964 Monson Motor Lodge protests.\nIn response to racial segregation in Florida, a number of protests occurred in Florida during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1956â€“1957, students at Florida A&M University organized a bus boycott in Tallahassee to mimic the Montgomery bus boycott and succeeded in integrating the city\'s buses.[59] Students also held sit-ins in 1960 in protest of segregated seating at local lunch counters, and in 1964 an incident at a St. Augustine motel pool, in which the owner poured acid into the water during a demonstration, influenced the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[60]\nEconomic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the Florida land boom of the 1920s, which brought a brief period of intense land development. In 1925, the Seaboard Air Line broke the FEC\'s southeast Florida monopoly and extended its freight and passenger service to West Palm Beach; two years later it extended passenger service to Miami. Devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928, followed by the Great Depression, brought that period to a halt. Florida\'s economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for World War II.\n\nMiami\'s Freedom Tower, built in 1925, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nIn 1939, Florida was described as \"still very largely an empty State.\"[61] Subsequently, the growing availability of air conditioning, the climate, and a low cost of living made the state a haven. Migration from the Rust Belt and the Northeast sharply increased Florida\'s population after 1945. In the 1960s, many refugees from Cuba fleeing Fidel Castro\'s communist regime arrived in Miami at the Freedom Tower, where the federal government used the facility to process, document and provide medical and dental services for the newcomers. As a result, the Freedom Tower was also called the \"Ellis Island of the South\".[62] In recent decades, more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy.\n\nWalt Disney World opened on October 1, 1971, near the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee.\nWith a population of more than 18 million, according to the 2010 census, Florida is the most populous state in the southeastern United States and the third-most populous in the United States.[63] The population of Florida has boomed in recent years with the state being the recipient of the largest number of out-of-state movers in the country as of 2019.[64] Florida\'s growth has been widespread, as cities throughout the state have continued to see population growth.[65]\nIn 2012, the killing of Trayvon Martin, a young black man, by George Zimmerman in Sanford drew national attention to Florida\'s stand-your-ground laws, and sparked African-American activism, including the Black Lives Matter movement.[66]\nAfter Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017, a large population of Puerto Ricans began moving to Florida to escape the widespread destruction. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans arrived in Florida after Maria dissipated, with nearly half of them arriving in Orlando and large populations also moving to Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach.[67]\n\nMemorials to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting left on the fence of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016.\nA handful of high-profile mass shootings have occurred in Florida in the 21st century. In June 2016, a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. It is the deadliest incident in the history of violence against LGBT people in the United States, as well as the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and it was the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in U.S. history until the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. In February 2018, 17 people were killed in a school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leading to new gun control regulations at both the state and federal level.[68]\nOn June 24, 2021, a condominium in Surfside, Florida, near Miami collapsed, killing at least 97 people.[69] The Surfside collapse is tied with the Knickerbocker Theatre collapse as the third-deadliest structural engineering failure in United States history, behind the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse and the collapse of the Pemberton Mill.[70][71]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of Florida\nSee also: List of counties in Florida, List of places in Florida, List of municipalities in Florida, List of islands of Florida, and List of Florida state parks\nMuch of Florida is on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits of Florida. Spanning two time zones, it extends to the northwest into a panhandle, extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is bordered on the north by Georgia and Alabama, and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is the only state that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Florida also is the southernmost of the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii being the only one of the fifty states reaching farther south. Florida is west of the Bahamas and 90 miles (140 km) north of Cuba. Florida is one of the largest states east of the Mississippi River, and only Alaska and Michigan are larger in water area. The water boundary is 3 nautical miles (3.5 mi; 5.6 km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean[72] and 9 nautical miles (10 mi; 17 km) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.[72]\nAt 345 feet (105 m) above mean sea level, Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any U.S. state.[73] Much of the state south of Orlando lies at a lower elevation than northern Florida, and is fairly level. Much of the state is at or near sea level. Some places, such as Clearwater have promontories that rise 50 to 100 ft (15 to 30 m) above the water. Much of Central and North Florida, typically 25 mi (40 km) or more away from the coastline, have rolling hills with elevations ranging from 100 to 250 ft (30 to 76 m). The highest point in peninsular Florida (east and south of the Suwannee River), Sugarloaf Mountain, is a 312-foot (95 m) peak in Lake County.[74] On average, Florida is the flattest state in the United States.[75]\n\nFlorida is mostly low-lying and flat as this topographic map shows.\nLake Okeechobee, the largest lake in Florida, is the tenth-largest natural freshwater lake among the 50 states of the United States and the second-largest natural freshwater lake contained entirely within the contiguous 48 states, after Lake Michigan.[76] The longest river within Florida is the St. Johns River, at 310 miles (500 km) long. The drop in elevation from its headwaters South Florida to its mouth in Jacksonville is less than 30 feet (9.1 m).\n\nClimate\nMain article: Climate of Florida\nSee also: List of Florida hurricanes and U.S. state temperature extremes\nThe state tree, Sabal palmetto, flourishes in Florida\'s overall warm climate.\nThe climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is distant from the ocean. North of Lake Okeechobee, the prevalent climate is humid subtropical (KÃ¶ppen: Cfa), while areas south of the lake (including the Florida Keys) have a true tropical climate (KÃ¶ppen: Aw, Am, and Af).[77] Mean high temperatures for late July are primarily in the low 90s Fahrenheit (32â€“34 Â°C). Mean low temperatures for early to mid January range from the low 40s Fahrenheit (4â€“7 Â°C) in north Florida to above 60 Â°F (16 Â°C) from Miami on southward. With an average daily temperature of 70.7 Â°F (21.5 Â°C), it is the warmest state in the U.S.[78][79]\nIn the summer, high temperatures in the state rarely exceed 100 Â°F (37.8 Â°C). Several record cold maxima have been in the 30s Â°F (âˆ’1 to 4 Â°C) and record lows have been in the 10s (âˆ’12 to âˆ’7 Â°C). These temperatures normally extend at most a few days at a time in the northern and central parts of Florida. South Florida rarely dips below freezing.[80] The hottest temperature ever recorded in Florida was 109 Â°F (43 Â°C), which was set on June 29, 1931, in Monticello. The coldest temperature was âˆ’2 Â°F (âˆ’19 Â°C), on February 13, 1899, just 25 miles (40 km) away, in Tallahassee.[81][82]\nDue to its subtropical and tropical climate, Florida rarely receives measurable snowfall.[83] On rare occasions, a combination of cold moisture and freezing temperatures can result in snowfall in the farthest northern regions like Jacksonville, Gainesville or Pensacola. Frost, which is more common than snow, sometimes occurs in the panhandle.[84] The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range from zone 8a (no colder than 10 Â°F or âˆ’12 Â°C) in the inland western panhandle to zone 11b (no colder than 45 Â°F or 7 Â°C) in the lower Florida Keys.[85] Fog also occurs all over the state or climate of Florida.[86]\n\n\n\nAverage high and low temperatures for various Florida cities\n\n\nÂ°F\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\n\nJacksonville[87]\n\n65/42\n\n68/45\n\n74/50\n\n79/55\n\n86/63\n\n90/70\n\n92/73\n\n91/73\n\n87/69\n\n80/61\n\n74/51\n\n67/44\n\n\nMiami[88]\n\n76/60\n\n78/62\n\n80/65\n\n83/68\n\n87/73\n\n89/76\n\n91/77\n\n91/77\n\n89/76\n\n86/73\n\n82/68\n\n78/63\n\n\nOrlando[89]\n\n71/49\n\n74/52\n\n78/56\n\n83/60\n\n88/66\n\n91/72\n\n92/74\n\n92/74\n\n90/73\n\n85/66\n\n78/59\n\n73/52\n\n\nPensacola[90]\n\n61/43\n\n64/46\n\n70/51\n\n76/58\n\n84/66\n\n89/72\n\n90/74\n\n90/74\n\n87/70\n\n80/60\n\n70/50\n\n63/45\n\n\nTallahassee[91]\n\n64/39\n\n68/42\n\n74/47\n\n80/52\n\n87/62\n\n91/70\n\n92/72\n\n92/72\n\n89/68\n\n82/57\n\n73/48\n\n66/41\n\n\nTampa[92]\n\n70/51\n\n73/54\n\n77/58\n\n81/62\n\n88/69\n\n90/74\n\n90/75\n\n91/76\n\n89/74\n\n85/67\n\n78/60\n\n72/54\n\n\n\nÂ°C\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\n\nJacksonville\n\n18/6\n\n20/7\n\n23/10\n\n26/13\n\n30/17\n\n32/21\n\n33/23\n\n33/23\n\n31/21\n\n27/16\n\n23/11\n\n19/7\n\n\nMiami\n\n24/16\n\n26/17\n\n27/18\n\n28/20\n\n31/23\n\n32/24\n\n33/25\n\n33/25\n\n32/24\n\n30/23\n\n28/20\n\n26/17\n\n\nOrlando\n\n22/9\n\n23/11\n\n26/13\n\n28/16\n\n31/19\n\n33/22\n\n33/23\n\n33/23\n\n32/23\n\n29/19\n\n26/15\n\n23/11\n\n\nPensacola\n\n16/6\n\n18/8\n\n21/11\n\n24/14\n\n29/19\n\n32/22\n\n32/23\n\n32/23\n\n31/21\n\n27/16\n\n21/10\n\n17/7\n\n\nTallahassee\n\n18/4\n\n20/6\n\n23/8\n\n27/11\n\n31/17\n\n33/21\n\n33/22\n\n33/22\n\n32/20\n\n28/14\n\n23/9\n\n19/5\n\n\nTampa\n\n21/11\n\n23/12\n\n25/14\n\n27/17\n\n31/21\n\n32/23\n\n32/24\n\n33/24\n\n32/23\n\n29/19\n\n26/16\n\n22/12\n\nFlorida\'s nickname is the \"Sunshine State\", but severe weather is a common occurrence in the state. Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the United States, as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country.[93] Florida has one of the highest average precipitation levels of any state,[94] in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in much of the state from late spring until early autumn.[95] A narrow eastern part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. The rest of the state, including Miami, receives between 2,800 and 3,200 hours annually.[96]\nFlorida leads the United States in tornadoes per area (when including waterspouts),[97] but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and Great Plains. Hail often accompanies the most severe thunderstorms.[98]\nHurricanes pose a severe threat each year from June 1 to November 30, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas.[99]\nFrom 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them majorâ€”category 3 and above.[99] It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.[100]\nIn 1992, Florida was the site of what was then the costliest weather disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Andrew, which caused more than $25 billion in damages when it struck during August; it held that distinction until 2005, when Hurricane Katrina surpassed it, and it has since been surpassed by six other hurricanes. Andrew is the second-costliest hurricane in Florida\'s history.[101]\n\nFauna\nFurther information: Fauna of Florida and List of invasive species in Florida\nAn alligator in the Everglades\nWest Indian manatee\nFlorida is host to many types of wildlife including:\n\nMarine mammals: bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, North Atlantic right whale, West Indian manatee\nMammals: Florida panther, northern river otter, mink, eastern cottontail rabbit, marsh rabbit, raccoon, striped skunk, squirrel, white-tailed deer, Key deer, bobcats, red fox, gray fox, coyote, wild boar, Florida black bear, nine-banded armadillos, Virginia opossum\nReptiles: eastern diamondback and pygmy rattlesnakes, gopher tortoise, green and leatherback sea turtles,[102] brown anoles, and eastern indigo snake. In 2012, there were about one million American alligators and 1,500 crocodiles.[103]\nBirds: peregrine falcon,[104] bald eagle, American flamingo,[105] crested caracara, snail kite, osprey, white and brown pelicans, sea gulls, whooping and sandhill cranes, roseate spoonbill, American white ibis, Florida scrub jay (state endemic), and others. One subspecies of wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo osceola, is found only in Florida.[106] The state is a wintering location for many species of eastern North American birds.\nAs a result of climate change, there have been small numbers of several new species normally native to cooler areas to the north: snowy owls, snow buntings, harlequin ducks, and razorbills. These have been seen in the northern part of the state.[107]\nInvertebrates: carpenter ants, termites, American cockroach, Africanized bees, the Miami blue butterfly, and the grizzled mantis.\nFlorida also has more than 500 nonnative animal species and 1,000 nonnative insects found throughout the state.[108] Some exotic species living in Florida include the Burmese python, green iguana, veiled chameleon, Argentine black and white tegu, peacock bass, mayan cichlid, lionfish, White-nosed coati, rhesus macaque, vervet monkey, Cuban tree frog, cane toad, Indian peafowl, monk parakeet, tui parakeet, and many more. Some of these nonnative species do not pose a threat to any native species, but some do threaten the native species of Florida by living in the state and eating them.[109]\n\nFlora\nFurther information: Florida mangroves and List of invasive plant species in Florida\nRed mangroves in Everglades National Park\nThe state has more than 26,000 square miles (67,000 km2) of forests, covering about half of the state\'s land area.[110]\nThere are about 3,000 different types of wildflowers in Florida.[111] This is the third-most diverse state in the union, behind California and Texas, both larger states.[112] In Florida, wild populations of coconut palms extend up the East Coast from Key West to Jupiter Inlet, and up the West Coast from Marco Island to Sarasota. Many of the smallest coral islands in the Florida Keys are known to have abundant coconut palms sprouting from coconuts deposited by ocean currents. Coconut palms are cultivated north of south Florida to roughly Cocoa Beach on the East Coast and the Tampa Bay area on the West Coast.[113]\nOn the east coast of the state, mangroves have normally dominated the coast from Cocoa Beach southward; salt marshes from St. Augustine northward. From St. Augustine south to Cocoa Beach, the coast fluctuates between the two, depending on the annual weather conditions.[107] All three mangrove species flower in the spring and early summer. Propagules are produced from late summer through early autumn.[114] Florida mangrove plant communities covered an estimated 430,000 to 540,000 acres (1,700 to 2,200 km2) in Florida in 1981. Ninety percent of the Florida mangroves are in southern Florida, in Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties.\n\nReef\nMain article: Florida Reef\nFish and corals in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo\nThe Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States.[115] It is also the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world, after the Great Barrier Reef and the Belize Barrier Reef.[116] The reef lies a little bit off of the coast of the Florida Keys. A lot of the reef lies within John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which was the first underwater park in the United States.[117] The park contains a lot of tropical vegetation, marine life, and seabirds. The Florida Reef extends into other parks and sanctuaries as well including Dry Tortugas National Park, Biscayne National Park, and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Almost 1,400 species of marine plants and animals, including more than 40 species of stony corals and 500 species of fish, live on the Florida Reef.[118] The Florida Reef, being a delicate ecosystem like other coral reefs, faces many threats including overfishing, plastics in the ocean, coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and changes in sea surface temperature.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nMain article: Environment of Florida\nSee also: Environmental issues in Florida\nAmerican flamingos in South Florida\nAn American alligator and an invasive Burmese python in Everglades National Park\nFlorida is a low per capita energy user.[119] As of 2008[update], it is estimated that approximately 4% of energy in the state is generated through renewable resources.[120] Florida\'s energy production is 6% of the nation\'s total energy output, while total production of pollutants is lower, with figures of 6% for nitrogen oxide, 5% for carbon dioxide, and 4% for sulfur dioxide.[120] Wildfires in Florida occur at all times of the year.[121]\nAll potable water resources have been controlled by the state government through five regional water authorities since 1972.[122]\nRed tide has been an issue on the southwest coast of Florida, as well as other areas. While there has been a great deal of conjecture over the cause of the toxic algae bloom, there is no evidence that it is being caused by pollution or that there has been an increase in the duration or frequency of red tides.[123] Red tide is now killing off wildlife or Tropical fish and coral reefs putting all in danger.[124]\nThe Florida panther is close to extinction. A record 23 were killed in 2009, mainly by automobile collisions, leaving about 100 individuals in the wild. The Center for Biological Diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established.[125] Manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction.[126] American flamingos are rare to see in Florida due to being hunted in the 1900s, where it was to a point considered completely extirpated. Now the flamingos are reproducing toward making a comeback to South Florida since it is adamantly considered native to the state and also are now being protected.[127][128]\nMuch of Florida has an elevation of less than 12 feet (3.7 m), including many populated areas. Therefore, it is susceptible to rising sea levels associated with global warming.[129] The Atlantic beaches that are vital to the state\'s economy are being washed out to sea due to rising sea levels caused by climate change. The Miami beach area, close to the continental shelf, is running out of accessible offshore sand reserves.[130] Elevated temperatures can damage coral reefs, causing coral bleaching. The first recorded bleaching incident on the Florida Reef was in 1973. Incidents of bleaching have become more frequent in recent decades, in correlation with a rise in sea surface temperatures. White band disease has also adversely affected corals on the Florida Reef.[131]\n\nGeology\nMain article: Geology of Florida\nThe Florida Keys as seen from a satellite, December 2003[132]\nThe Florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the Florida Platform.\nThe largest deposits of potash in the United States are found in Florida.[133] The largest deposits of rock phosphate in the country are found in Florida.[133] Most of this is in Bone Valley.[134]\nExtended systems of underwater caves, sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents.[135] The limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell. During the last glacial period, lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula, largely savanna.[136] While there are sinkholes in much of the state, modern sinkholes have tended to be in West-Central Florida.[137][138] Everglades National Park covers 1,509,000 acres (6,110 km2), throughout Dade, Monroe, and Collier counties in Florida.[139] The Everglades, an enormously wide, slow-flowing river encompasses the southern tip of the peninsula. Sinkhole damage claims on property in the state exceeded a total of $2 billion from 2006 through 2010.[140] Winter Park Sinkhole, in central Florida, appeared May 8, 1981. It was approximately 350 feet (107 m) wide and 75 feet (23 m) deep. It was one of the largest recent sinkholes to form in the United States. It is now known as Lake Rose.[141] The Econlockhatchee River (Econ River for short) is an 54.5-mile-long (87.7 km)[142] north-flowing blackwater tributary of the St. Johns River, the longest river in the U.S. state of Florida. The Econ River flows through Osceola, Orange, and Seminole counties in Central Florida, just east of the Orlando Metropolitan Area (east of State Road 417). It is a designated Outstanding Florida Waters.[143]\nEarthquakes are rare because Florida is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries.[144]\n\nRegions\nAll of the 67 counties in Florida\n\nFlorida Panhandle\nEmerald Coast\nForgotten Coast\nNorth Florida\nPensacola metropolitan area\nTallahassee metropolitan area\nNorth Central Florida\nBig Bend\nNature Coast\nNorth Florida\nGainesville metropolitan area\nNortheast Florida\nFirst Coast\nJacksonville metropolitan area\nNorth Florida\nCentral West Florida\nNature Coast\nTampa Bay area\nFlorida Suncoast\nCentral Florida\nGreater Orlando\nCentral East Florida\nDeltonaâ€“Daytona Beachâ€“Ormond Beach metropolitan area\nSurf Coast/Fun Coast/Halifax Area\nSpace Coast\nTreasure Coast\nSouthwest Florida\nFlorida Heartland\nFlorida Everglades\nFlorida Suncoast\nSarasota metropolitan area\nTen Thousand Islands\nSouth Florida\nEverglades\nGold Coast\nFlorida Keys\nMiami metropolitan area\n\nCities and towns\nSee also: List of metropolitan areas of Florida, List of municipalities in Florida, and List of urbanized areas in Florida (by population)\nThe largest metropolitan area in the state as well as the entire southeastern United States is the Miami metropolitan area, with about 6.06 million people. The Tampa Bay area, with more than 3.02 million, is the second-largest; the Orlando metropolitan area, with more than 2.44 million, is third; and the Jacksonville metropolitan area, with more than 1.47 million, is fourth.[145]\nFlorida has 22 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Forty-three of Florida\'s 67 counties are in an MSA.\nThe legal name in Florida for a city, town or village is \"municipality\". In Florida there is no legal difference between towns, villages and cities.[146]\nFlorida is a highly urbanized state, with 89 percent of its population living in urban areas in\n2000, compared to 79 percent across the U.S.[147]\nIn 2012, 75% of the population lived within 10 miles (16 km) of the coastline.[148]\n\n\n\n\n\n   Largest cities or towns in FloridaSource:[149]\n\n\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\n\n\nJacksonvilleMiami\n\n1\nJacksonville\nDuval\n949,611\n11\nPembroke Pines\nBroward\n171,178\n\nTampaOrlando\n\n\n2\nMiami\nMiami-Dade\n442,241\n12\nHollywood\nBroward\n153,067\n\n\n3\nTampa\nHillsborough\n384,959\n13\nGainesville\nAlachua\n141,085\n\n\n4\nOrlando\nOrange\n307,573\n14\nMiramar\nBroward\n134,721\n\n\n5\nSt. Petersburg\nPinellas\n258,308\n15\nCoral Springs\nBroward\n134,394\n\n\n6\nHialeah\nMiami-Dade\n223,109\n16\nPalm Bay\nBrevard\n119,760\n\n\n7\nPort St. Lucie\nSt. Lucie\n204,851\n17\nWest Palm Beach\nPalm Beach\n117,415\n\n\n8\nTallahassee\nLeon\n196,169\n18\nClearwater\nPinellas\n117,292\n\n\n9\nCape Coral\nLee\n194,016\n19\nLakeland\nPolk\n112,641\n\n\n10\nFort Lauderdale\nBroward\n182,760\n20\nPompano Beach\nBroward\n112,046\n\n\nDemographics\nMain article: Demographics of Florida\nSee also: Culture of Florida\nPopulation\nPopulation density of Florida according to the 2020 census\nCuban American men playing dominoes in Miami\'s Little Havana.

The center of population has moved less than 5 miles (8 km) to the east and approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north between 1980 and 2010 and has been located in Polk County since the 1960 census.[156] The population exceeded 19.7 million by December 2014, surpassing the population of the state of New York for the first time, making Florida the third most populous state.[157][158] The Florida population was 21,477,737 residents or people according to the U.S. Census Bureau\'s 2019 Population Estimates Program.[159] By the 2020 census, its population increased to 21,538,187.\nIn 2010, undocumented immigrants constituted an estimated 5.7% of the population. This was the sixth highest percentage of any U.S. state.[160][b] There were an estimated 675,000 illegal immigrants in the state in 2010.[161] Florida has banned sanctuary cities.[162]\nThe top countries of origin for Florida\'s immigrants were Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Mexico and Jamaica in 2018.[163]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 25,959 homeless people in Florida.[164][165]\n\nEthnic origins in Florida\n\nFlorida racial breakdown\nhide\n\nRacial composition\n1970[166]\n1990[166]\n2000[167]\n2010[168]\n2020[169][170]\n\n\nHispanic or Latino (of any race)\n6.6%\n12.2%\n16.8%\n22.5%\n26.5%\n\n\nBlack or African American alone\n15.3%\n13.6%\n14.6%\n16.0%\n15.1%\n\n\nAsian alone\n0.2%\n1.2%\n1.7%\n2.4%\n3.0%\n\n\nNative American alone\n0.1%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.4%\n0.4%\n\n\nTwo or more races\nâ€”\nâ€”\n2.3%\n2.5%\n16.5%\n\n\nWhite alone, not Hispanic or Latino\n77.9%\n73.2%\n65.4%\n57.9%\n51.5%\n\n\nWhite alone\n84.2%\n83.1%\n78.0%\n75.0%\n57.7%\n\nIn 2010, 6.9% of the population (1,269,765) considered themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity).[171][172] Many of these were of English or Scotch-Irish descent, whose families have lived in the state for so long they choose to identify as having \"American\" ancestry or do not know their ancestry.[173][174][175][176][177][178] In the 1980 United States census, the largest ancestry group reported in Florida was English with 2,232,514 Floridians claiming they were of English or mostly English American ancestry.[179] Some of their ancestry dated to the original thirteen colonies.\nAs of 2010[update], those of (non-Hispanic white) European ancestry accounted for 57.9% of Florida\'s population. Out of the 57.9%, the largest groups were 12.0% German (2,212,391), 10.7% Irish (1,979,058), 8.8% English (1,629,832), 6.6% Italian (1,215,242), 2.8% Polish (511,229), and 2.7% French (504,641).[171][172] White Americans of all European backgrounds are present in all areas of the state. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites constituted nearly 80% of Florida\'s population.[180] Those of English and Irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas across the state. Some native white Floridians, especially those who have descended from long-time Florida families, may refer to themselves as \"Florida crackers\"; others see the term as a derogatory one. Like whites in most other states of the southern U.S., they descend mainly from English and Scots-Irish settlers, as well as some other British American settlers.[181]\nAs of 2010, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 22.5% (4,223,806) of Florida\'s population. Out of the 22.5%, the largest groups were 6.5% (1,213,438) Cuban, and 4.5% (847,550) Puerto Rican.[151] Florida\'s Hispanic population includes large communities of Cuban Americans in Miami and Tampa, Puerto Ricans in Orlando and Tampa, and Mexican/Central American migrant workers. The Hispanic community continues to grow more affluent and mobile. Florida has a large and diverse Hispanic population, with Cubans and Puerto Ricans being the largest groups in the state. Nearly 80% of Cuban Americans live in Florida, especially South Florida where there is a long-standing and affluent Cuban community.[182] Florida has the second-largest Puerto Rican population after New York, as well as the fastest-growing in the U.S.[183] Puerto Ricans are more widespread throughout the state, though the heaviest concentrations are in the Orlando area of Central Florida.[184] Florida has one of the largest and most diverse Hispanic/Latino populations in the country, especially in South Florida around Miami, and to a lesser degree Central Florida. Aside from the dominant Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, there are also large populations of Mexicans, Colombians, Venezuelans and Dominicans, among numerous other groups, as most Latino groups have sizable numbers in the state.\nAs of 2010[update], those of African ancestry accounted for 16.0% of Florida\'s population, which includes African Americans. Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American.[171][172][151] During the early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state\'s population.[185] In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960, the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%.[186] Conversely, large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[187] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found throughout Florida. Aside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the southern U.S., there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South Florida area.[188] Florida has the largest West Indian population of any state, originating from many Caribbean countries, with Haitian Americans being the most numerous.\nIn 2016, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians in the United States at 4.5%, with 2.3% (483,874) from Haitian ancestry, 1.5% (303,527) Jamaican, and 0.2% (31,966) Bahamian, with the other West Indian groups making up the rest.[189]\nAs of 2010[update], those of Asian ancestry accounted for 2.4% of Florida\'s population.[171][172]\nAs of 2011, Florida contains the highest percentage of people over 65 (17.3%) in the U.S.[190] There were 186,102 military retirees living in the state in 2008.[191] About two-thirds of the population was born in another state, the second-highest in the U.S.[192]\nIn 2020, Hispanic and Latinos of any race(s) made up 26.5% of the population, while Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders made up 0.1% of all Broward County residents.[193]\n\nLanguages\nSee also: Demographics of Florida Â§ Languages, and Miami accent\nIn 1988, English was affirmed as the state\'s official language in the Florida Constitution. Spanish is also widely spoken, especially as immigration has continued from Latin America.[194] About twenty percent of the population speak Spanish as their first language. Twenty-seven percent of Florida\'s population reports speaking a mother language other than English, and more than 200 first languages other than English are spoken at home in the state.[195][196]\nThe most common languages spoken in Florida as a first language in 2010 are:[195]\n\n73% English\n20% Spanish\n2% Haitian Creole\nOther languages less than 1% each\nReligion\nChurch of the Little Flower in Coral Gables, Florida\nHindu Temple of Florida in Tampa\nFlorida is mostly Christian (70%),[197] although there is a large irreligious and relatively significant Jewish community. Protestants account for almost half of the population, but the Catholic Church is the largest single denomination in the state mainly due to its large Hispanic population and other groups like Haitians. Protestants are very diverse, although Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals and nondenominational Protestants are the largest groups. Smaller Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Jehovah\'s Witnesses. There is also a sizable Jewish community in South Florida. This is the largest Jewish population in the southern U.S. and the third-largest in the U.S. behind those of New York and California.[198]\nIn 2010, the three largest denominations in Florida were the Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the United Methodist Church.[199]\nThe Pew Research Center survey in 2014 gave the following religious makeup of Florida:[200]\n\n\n\n\nReligion in Florida (2014)[197]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtestant\nâ€‰\n46%\n\n\nCatholic\nâ€‰\n21%\n\n\nMormon\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nJehovah\'s Witness\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nOther Christian\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nNothing in Particular\nâ€‰\n17%\n\n\nAgnostic\nâ€‰\n4%\n\n\nAtheist\nâ€‰\n3%\n\n\nJewish\nâ€‰\n3%\n\n\nOther faiths(e.g. Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism)\nâ€‰\n3%\n\n\n\n\nGovernance\nMain article: Government of Florida\nSee also: List of governors of Florida, United States congressional delegations from Florida, List of United States senators from Florida, and Florida Cabinet\nOld and New Florida State Capitol, Tallahassee, East view\nThe basic structure, duties, function, and operations of the government of the State of Florida are defined by the Florida Constitution, which establishes the basic law of the state and guarantees various rights and freedoms of the people. As with the American federal government and all other state governments, Florida\'s government consists of three separate branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed by the governor, become law.\nThe Florida Legislature comprises the Florida Senate, which has 40 members, and the Florida House of Representatives, which has 120 members. The governor of Florida is Ron DeSantis. The Florida Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six justices.\nFlorida has 67 counties. Some reference materials may show only 66 because Duval County is consolidated with the City of Jacksonville. There are 379 cities in Florida (out of 411) that report regularly to the Florida Department of Revenue, but there are other incorporated municipalities that do not. The primary revenue source for cities and counties is property tax; properties with unpaid taxes are subject to tax sales, which are held at the county level in May and are highly popular, due to the extensive use of online bidding sites.\nThe state government\'s primary revenue source is sales tax. Florida is one of eight states that do not impose a personal income tax.\nThere were 800 federal corruption convictions from 1988 to 2007, more than any other state.[201]\nIn a 2020 study, Florida was ranked as the 11th hardest state for citizens to vote in.[202] In April 2022, the legislature passed and the governor signed a new election law prohibiting Floridians from using ranked-choice voting in all federal, state and municipal elections.[203]\nFlorida retains the death penalty. Authorized methods of execution include the electric chair and lethal injection.[204]\n\nElections history\nFurther information: Elections in Florida, Politics of Florida, Political party strength in Florida, and United States presidential elections in Florida\nFrom 1952 to 1964, most voters were registered Democrats, but the state voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for 1964. The following year, Congress passed and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for African Americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement which had excluded most of them for decades from the political process.\nFrom the 1930s through much of the 1960s, Florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative Democrats, who together with other Democrats of the Solid South, exercised considerable control in Congress. They have gained slightly less federal money from national programs than they have paid in taxes.[205] Since the 1970s, conservative white voters in the state have largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Though the majority of registered voters in Florida were Democrats,[206] it continued to support Republican presidential candidates through 2004, except in 1976 and 1996, when the Democratic nominee was from the South.\nIn the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Barack Obama carried the state as a northern Democrat, attracting high voter turnout, especially among the young, independents, and minority voters, of whom Hispanics comprise an increasingly large proportion. 2008 marked the first time since 1944, when Franklin D. Roosevelt carried the state for the fourth time, that Florida was carried by a Northern Democrat for president.\nThe first post-Reconstruction era Republican elected to Congress from Florida was William C. Cramer in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast,[207] where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans were still disenfranchised by the state\'s constitution and discriminatory practices; in the 19th century, they had made up most of the Republican Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states. In 1966, Claude R. Kirk Jr. was elected as the first post-Reconstruction Republican governor, in an upset election.[208] In 1968, Edward J. Gurney, also a white conservative, was elected as the state\'s first post-reconstruction Republican US senator.[209] In 1970, Democrats took the governorship and the open US Senate seat and maintained dominance for years.\nFlorida is sometimes considered a bellwether state in presidential elections because every candidate who won the state from 1996 until 2016 won the election.[210] The 2020 election broke that streak when Donald Trump won Florida but lost the election.\nIn 1998, Democratic voters dominated areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white liberals from the northeastern United States, known colloquially as \"snowbirds\".[211] South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area became dominated by both racial minorities and white liberals. Because of this, the area has consistently voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. The Daytona Beach area is similar demographically and the city of Orlando has a large Hispanic population, which has often favored Democrats. Republicans, made up mostly of white conservatives, have dominated throughout much of the rest of Florida, including Jacksonville and the panhandle and particularly in the more rural and suburban areas. This is characteristic of its voter base throughout the Deep South.[211]\nThe fast-growing I-4 corridor area, which runs through Central Florida and connects the cities of Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area has often been seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state in federal presidential elections.[212]\nHistorically, the Democratic Party maintained an edge in voter registration, both statewide and in the state\'s three most populous counties, Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County.[213][when?]\n\n2000â€“present\nIn 2000, George W. Bush won the U.S. presidential election by a margin of 271â€“266 in the Electoral College.[214] Of the 271 electoral votes for Bush, 25 were cast by electors from Florida.[215] The Florida results were contested and a recount was ordered by the court, with the results settled in a Supreme Court decision, Bush v. Gore.\nReapportionment following the 2010 United States census gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives.[216] The legislature\'s redistricting, announced in 2012, was quickly challenged in court, on the grounds that it had unfairly benefited Republican interests. In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on appeal that the congressional districts had to be redrawn because of the legislature\'s violation of the Fair District Amendments to the state constitution passed in 2010; it accepted a new map in early December 2015.\nThe political make-up of congressional and legislative districts has enabled Republicans to control the governorship and most statewide elective offices, and 17 of the state\'s 27 seats in the 2012 House of Representatives.[217] Florida has been listed as a swing state in presidential elections since 1952, voting for the losing candidate only twice in that period of time.[218]\n\nTreemap of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election\nIn the closely contested 2000 election, the state played a pivotal role.[214][215][219][220][221][222] Out of more than 5.8 million votes for the two main contenders Bush and Al Gore, around 500 votes separated the two candidates for the all-decisive Florida electoral votes that landed Bush the election win. Florida\'s felony disenfranchisement law is more severe than most European nations or other American states. A 2002 study in the American Sociological Review concluded that \"if the state\'s 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Floridaâ€”and the presidencyâ€”by more than 80,000 votes.\"[223]\nIn 2008, delegates of both the Republican Florida primary election and Democratic Florida primary election were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met in August due to violation of both parties\' national rules.\nIn the 2010 elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning the governor\'s mansion, and maintaining firm majorities in both houses of the state legislature. They won four previously Democratic-held seats to create a 19â€“6 Republican majority delegation representing Florida in the federal House of Representatives.\nIn 2010, more than 63% of state voters approved the initiated Amendments 5 and 6 to the state constitution, to ensure more fairness in districting. These have become known as the Fair District Amendments. As a result of the 2010 United States Census, Florida gained two House of Representative seats in 2012.[216] The legislature issued revised congressional districts in 2012, which were immediately challenged in court by supporters of the above amendments.\nThe court ruled in 2014, after lengthy testimony, that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering. After this was appealed, in July 2015 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives, and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn. On December 2, 2015, a 5â€“2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts, some of which was drawn by challengers. Their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by Leon County Judge Terry Lewis, who had overseen the original trial. It particularly makes changes in South Florida. There are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts.[224]\n\n\nVoter registration totals as of March 31, 2024[225]\n\n\nParty\n\nRegistered voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n5,243,299\n\n38.92%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n4,351,265\n\n32.30%\n\n\n\n\nUnaffiliated\n\n3,533,149\n\n26.23%\n\n\n\n\nMinor parties\n\n343,932\n\n2.55%\n\n\nTotal\n\n13,471,645\n\n100.00%\n\nAccording to The Sentencing Project, the effect of Florida\'s felony disenfranchisement law is such that in 2014, \"[m]ore than one in ten Floridiansâ€”and nearly one in four African-American Floridiansâ€”are [were] shut out of the polls because of felony convictions\", although they had completed sentences and parole/probation requirements.[226]\nThe state switched back to the GOP in the 2016 presidential election, and again in 2020, when Donald Trump headed the party\'s ticket both times. 2020 marked the first time Florida sided with the eventual loser of the presidential election since 1992.\nIn the 2018 elections, the ratio of Republican to Democratic representation fell from 16:11 to 14:13. The U.S. Senate election between Democratic incumbent senator Bill Nelson and then governor Rick Scott was close, with 49.93% voting for the incumbent and 50.06% voting for the former governor. Republicans also held onto the governorship in a close race between Republican candidate Ron DeSantis and Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum, with 49.6% voting for DeSantis and 49.3% voting for Gillum. In 2022, incumbent Governor DeSantis won reelection by a landslide against Democrat Charlie Crist. The unexpectedly large margin of victory led many pundits to question Florida\'s perennial status as a swing state, and instead identify it as a red state.[227]\nIn November 2021, for the first time in Florida\'s history, the total number of registered Republican voters exceeded the number of registered Democrats.[228]\n\nStatutes\nSee also: Law of Florida\nFlorida Supreme Court building in Tallahassee\nIn 1972, the state made personal injury protection auto insurance mandatory for drivers, becoming the second in the U.S. to enact a no-fault insurance law.[229] The ease of receiving payments under this law is seen as precipitating a major increase in insurance fraud.[230] Auto insurance fraud was the highest in the U.S. in 2011, estimated at close to $1 billion.[231] Fraud is particularly centered in the Miami-Dade and Tampa areas.[232][233][234]\nCapital punishment is applied in Florida.[235] If a person committing a predicate felony directly contributed to the death of the victim then the person will be charged with murder in the first degree. The only two sentences available for that statute are life imprisonment and the death penalty.[236][237] If a person commits a predicate felony, but was not the direct contributor to the death of the victim then the person will be charged with murder in the second degree. The maximum prison term is life.[236][237] In 1995, the legislature modified Chapter 921 to provide that felons should serve at least 85% of their sentence.[238][239]\nFlorida approved its lottery by amending the constitution in 1984. It approved slot machines in Broward and Miami-Dade County in 2004. It has disapproved casinos (outside of sovereign Seminole and Miccosukee tribal areas) three times: 1978, 1986, and 1994.[240]\n\nTaxation\nTax is collected by the Florida Department of Revenue.\n\nEconomy\nMain articles: Economy of Florida and Agriculture in Florida\nThe Brickell Financial District in Miami contains the largest concentration of international banks in the United States.\nVisitors enjoying the beach at Pensacola Beach\nThe economy of the state of Florida is the fourth-largest in the United States, with a $1.2 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2021.[241] If Florida were a sovereign nation (2021), it would rank as the world\'s 16th-largest economy according to the International Monetary Fund, ahead of Indonesia and behind Mexico.[241][242][243] In the 20th century, tourism, industry, construction, international banking, biomedical and life sciences, healthcare research, simulation training, aerospace and defense, and commercial space travel have contributed to the state\'s economic development.[244]\nTourism is a large portion of Florida\'s economy. Florida is home to the world\'s most visited theme park, the Magic Kingdom.[245] Florida is also home to the largest single-site employer in the United States, Walt Disney World.[246] PortMiami is the largest passenger port in the world and one of the largest cargo ports in the United States.[247] Beach towns have many visitors too as Florida is known around the world for its beaches.\nAgriculture is another large part of the Florida economy. Florida is the number one grower of oranges for juice,[248] mangoes,[249] fresh tomatoes,[250] sugar,[251] sweet corn, green beans,[252] beans, cucumbers, watermelons, and more.[253] Florida is also the second biggest producer of strawberries, avocadoes, grapefruit, and peppers in the U.S.[253][254]\nOther large sectors of Florida\'s economy include finance, government and military (especially in Jacksonville and Pensacola),[255] healthcare, aerospace (especially in the Space Coast), mining (especially for phosphate in Bone Valley), fishing, trade, real estate, and tech (especially in Miami, Orlando, and Tampa in the 2020s).\n\nHealthcare\nSee also: List of hospitals in Florida\nJackson Memorial Hospital in the Miami Health District, the primary teaching hospital of the University of Miami\'s Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine\nThere were 2.7 million Medicaid patients in Florida in 2009. The governor has proposed adding $2.6 billion to care for the expected 300,000 additional patients in 2011.[256] The cost of caring for 2.3 million clients in 2010 was $18.8 billion.[257]   This is nearly 30% of Florida\'s budget.[258] Medicaid paid for 60% of all births in Florida in 2009. The state has a program for those not covered by Medicaid.\nIn 2013, Florida refused to participate in providing coverage for the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act, colloquially called Obamacare. The Florida legislature also refused to accept additional Federal funding for Medicaid, although this would have helped its constituents at no cost to the state. As a result, Florida is second only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens without health insurance.[259]\nIn 2022, the largest hospital network in Florida is HCA Healthcare[260] and the second largest is AdventHealth.[261][262]\nIn 2023, the largest hospitals in Florida were Jackson Memorial Hospital, AdventHealth Orlando, Tampa General Hospital, UF Health Shands Hospital and Baptist Hospital of Miami.[263]\nMayo Clinic hosts one of its three major U.S. campuses in Jacksonville. The practice specializes in treating difficult cases through tertiary care and destination medicine.\n\nArchitecture\nSee also: Architecture of Miami and Architecture of Jacksonville\nMiami Art Deco District in South Beach, built during the 1920sâ€“1930s\nFlorida has the largest collection of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings, both in the United States and in the entire world, most of which are located in the Miami metropolitan area, especially Miami Beach\'s Art Deco District, constructed as the city was becoming a resort destination.[264] A unique architectural design found only in Florida is the post-World War II Miami Modern, which can be seen in areas such as Miami\'s MiMo Historic District.[265]\nBeing of early importance as a regional center of banking and finance, the architecture of Jacksonville displays a wide variety of styles and design principles. Many of the state\'s earliest skyscrapers were constructed in Jacksonville, dating as far back as 1902,[266] and last holding a state height record from 1974 to 1981.[267] The city is endowed with one of the largest collections of Prairie School buildings outside of the Midwest.[268] Jacksonville is also noteworthy for its collection of Mid-Century modern architecture.[269]\nSome sections of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival, Florida vernacular, and Mediterranean Revival.[270] A notable collection of these styles can be found in St. Augustine, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement within the borders of the United States.[271]\n\nEducation\nMain article: Education in Florida\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Florida, List of high schools in Florida, and List of school districts in Florida\nFlorida State University in Tallahassee\nUniversity of Miami in Coral Gables\nUniversity of Central Florida in Orlando\nFlorida International University in Miami\nUniversity of South Florida in Tampa\nUniversity of Florida in Gainesville\nIn 2020, Florida was ranked the third best state in America for K-12 education, outperforming the nation in 15 out of 18 metrics in Education Week\'s 2020 Quality Counts report.[272] In terms of K-12 Achievement, which measures progress in areas such as academic excellence and graduation rates, the state was graded \"Bâˆ’\" compared to a national average of C.[272] Florida\'s higher education was ranked first and pre-K-12 was ranked 27th best nationwide by U.S. News & World Report.[273]\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nWith an educational system made up of public school districts and independent private institutions, Florida had 2,833,115 students enrolled in 4,269 public primary, secondary, and vocational schools in Florida\'s 67 regular or seven special school districts as of 2018[update].[274] Miami-Dade County is the largest of Florida\'s 67 regular districts with more than 350 thousand students and Jefferson County is the smallest with less than one thousand students. Florida spent $8,920 for each student in 2016, and was 43rd in the U.S. in expenditures per student.[275]\nFlorida\'s primary and secondary school systems are administered by the Florida Department of Education. School districts are organized within county boundaries. Each school district has an elected Board of Education that sets policy, budget, goals, and approves expenditures. Management is the responsibility of a Superintendent of schools.\nThe Florida Department of Education is required by law to train educators in teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).[276]\nWhile Florida\'s public schools suffer from more than 5,000 unoccupied teacher positions, according to Karla HernÃ¡ndez, teacher and president of United Teachers of Dade, decisions made by the DeSantis administration will make the situation worse. She referred to its blocking of an Advanced Placement African American studies course,[277] book bans and removing some lessons in courses as \"really scary moments in the state of Florida\".[278]\nIn 2023, the state of Florida approved a public school curriculum including videos produced by conservative advocacy group PragerU, likening climate change skeptics to those who fought Communism and Nazism, implying renewable energy harms the environment, and saying global warming occurs naturally.[279] DeSantis has called climate change \"leftwing stuff\".[279]\nIn August 2023, restrictions have been placed on the teaching of Shakespearean plays and literature by Florida teachers in order to comply with state law.[280][281][282]\n\nHigher education\nThe State University System of Florida was founded in 1905, and is governed by the Florida Board of Governors. During the 2019 academic year, 346,604 students attended one of these twelve universities.[283] In 2016, Florida charged the second lowest tuition in the U.S. for four-year programs, at $26,000 for in-state students and $86,000 for out-of-state students; this compares with an average of $34,800 for in-state students.[284]\nAs of 2020, three Florida universities are among the top 10 largest universities by enrollment in the United States: The University of Central Florida in Orlando (2nd), the University of Florida in Gainesville (4th), and Florida International University in Miami (8th).\nThe Florida College System comprises 28 public community and state colleges with 68 campuses spread out throughout the state. In 2016, enrollment exceeded 813,000 students.[285]\nThe Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida is an association of 30 private, educational institutions in the state.[286] This Association reported that their member institutions served more than 158,000 students in the fall of 2020.[287]\nThe University of Miami in Coral Gables is one of the nation\'s top private research universities. Florida\'s first private university, Stetson University in DeLand, was founded in 1883.\nAs of 2023, three universities in Florida are members of the Association of American Universities: University of Florida, University of Miami and University of South Florida.[288]\n\nTransportation\nMain article: Transportation in Florida\nHighways\nFurther information: Florida State Highway System, List of state roads in Florida, and County roads in Florida\nFlorida\'s highway system contains 1,495 mi (2,406 km) of interstate highway, and 10,601 mi (17,061 km) of non-interstate highway, such as state highways and U.S. Highways. Florida\'s interstates, state highways, and U.S. Highways are maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation.[289]\nIn 2011, there were about 9,000 retail gas stations in the state. Floridians consumed 21 million gallons of gasoline daily in 2011, ranking it third in national use behind California and Texas.[290]\nAs of 2024, motorists in Florida have one of the highest rates of car insurance in the U.S.[291][292] 24% are uninsured.[293]\nDrivers between 15 and 19 years of age averaged 364 car crashes a year per ten thousand licensed Florida drivers in 2010. Drivers 70 and older averaged 95 per 10,000 during the same time frame. A spokesperson for the non-profit Insurance Institute stated \"Older drivers are more of a threat to themselves.\"[294]\nIntercity bus travel, which utilizes Florida\'s highway system, is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway.\nBefore the construction of routes under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Florida began construction of a long cross-state toll road, Florida\'s Turnpike. The first section, from Fort Pierce south to the Golden Glades Interchange was completed in 1957. After a second section north through Orlando to Wildwood (near present-day The Villages), and a southward extension around Miami to Homestead, it was finished in 1974.\n\nThe Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay is a part of Florida\'s interstate system.\nFlorida\'s primary interstate routes include:\n\n I-4, which spans 133 miles, bisects the state, connecting Tampa, Lakeland, Orlando, and Daytona Beach, connecting with I-75 in Tampa and I-95 in Daytona Beach.\n I-10, which spans 362 miles in Florida, traverses the panhandle, connecting Pensacola, Tallahassee, Lake City, and Jacksonville, with interchanges with I-75 in Lake City and I-95 in Jacksonville. It is the southernmost eastâ€“west interstate in the United States terminating in Santa Monica with a total length of 2460 miles.\n I-75, which spans 470 miles in Florida, enters the state near Lake City (45 miles (72 km) west of Jacksonville) and continues southward through Gainesville, Ocala, Tampa\'s eastern suburbs, Bradenton, Sarasota, Fort Myers and Naples, where it crosses the \"Alligator Alley\" as a toll road to Fort Lauderdale before turning southward and terminating in Hialeah/Miami Lakes having interchanges with I-10 in Lake City and I-4 in Tampa. It is the second longest northâ€“south interstate with a total length of 1786 miles and terminates at the Canadian border at Sault Ste.

The Atlanta metropolitan area, with a population of more than 6.3 million people in 2023, is the 6th most populous metropolitan area in the United States and contains about 57% of Georgia\'s entire population. Other major metropolitan areas in the state include Augusta, Savannah, Columbus, and Macon.[5] Georgia has 100 miles (160 km) of coastline along the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Province of Georgia was created in 1732 and first settled in 1733 with the founding of Savannah. Georgia became a British royal colony in 1752. It was the last and southernmost of the original Thirteen Colonies to be established.[6] Named after King George II of Great Britain, the Georgia Colony covered the area from South Carolina south to Spanish Florida and west to French Louisiana at the Mississippi River. On January 2, 1788, Georgia became the fourth state to ratify the United States Constitution.[7] From 1802 to 1804, western Georgia was split to form the Mississippi Territory, which later was admitted as the U.S. states of Alabama and Mississippi. Georgia declared its secession from the Union on January 19, 1861, and was one of the original seven Confederate States.[7] Following the Civil War, it was the last state to be restored to the Union, on July 15, 1870.[7] In the post-Reconstruction era of the late 19th century, Georgia\'s economy was transformed as a group of prominent politicians, businessmen, and journalists, led by Henry W. Grady, espoused the \"New South\" philosophy of sectional reconciliation and industrialization.[8] During the mid-20th century, several people from Georgia, most notably Martin Luther King Jr., were prominent leaders during the civil rights movement.[7] Atlanta was selected as host of the 1996 Summer Olympics, which marked the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games. Since 1945, Georgia has seen substantial population and economic growth as part of the broader Sun Belt phenomenon. From 2007 to 2008, 14 of Georgia\'s counties ranked among the nation\'s 100 fastest-growing.[9]\nGeorgia is defined by a diversity of landscapes, flora, and fauna. The state\'s northernmost regions include the Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the larger Appalachian Mountain system. The Piedmont plateau extends from the foothills of the Blue Ridge south to the Fall Line, an escarpment to the Coastal Plain defining the state\'s southern region. Georgia\'s highest point is Brasstown Bald at 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above sea level; the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean. With the exception of some high-altitude areas in the Blue Ridge, the entirety of the state has a humid subtropical climate. Of the states entirely east of the Mississippi River, Georgia is the largest in land area.[10]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Georgia (U.S. state)\nBefore settlement by Europeans, Georgia was inhabited by the mound building cultures. The Province of Georgia was founded by General James Oglethorpe at Savannah on February 12, 1733, a year after its creation as a new British colony.[11] It was administered by the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America under a charter issued by (and named for) King George II. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony\'s settlement, known as the Oglethorpe Plan, which envisioned an agrarian society of yeoman farmers and prohibited slavery. The colony was invaded by the Spanish in 1742, during the War of Jenkins\' Ear. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the crown. Georgia became a Crown colony, with a governor appointed by the king.[12]\nThe Province of Georgia was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution by signing the 1776 Declaration of Independence. The State of Georgia\'s first constitution was ratified in February 1777. Georgia was the 10th state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24, 1778,[13] and was the 4th state to ratify the United States Constitution on 2 January 1788.[14]\n\nSlaves with the cotton they had picked, Georgia circa 1850\nAfter the Creek War (1813â€“1814), General Andrew Jackson forced the Muscogee (Creek) tribes to surrender land to the state of Georgia, including in the Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814), surrendering 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama, and the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825).[15]\n\nThe Battle of Kennesaw Mountain 1864\nIn early 1861, Georgia joined the Confederacy (with secessionists having a slight majority of delegates)[16] and became a major theater of the Civil War. Major battles took place at Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain, and Atlanta. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman\'s March to the Sea. 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service, roughly one of every five who served.[17]\n\n\"Colored\" waiting room sign in 1943 for a bus terminal in Rome, Georgia, where Jim Crow laws created \"de jure\" legally required segregation\nWith white Democrats having regained power in the state legislature, they passed a poll tax in 1877, which disenfranchised many poor black (and some white) people, preventing them from registering.[18] In 1908 the state established a white primary. With the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party, it was another way to exclude black people from politics.[19] They constituted 46.7 percent of the state\'s population in 1900, but the proportion of Georgia\'s population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28 percent, primarily due to tens of thousands leaving the state during the Great Migration.[20] According to the Equal Justice Initiative\'s 2015 report on lynching in the United States (1877â€“1950), Georgia had 531 deaths, the second-highest total of these extralegal executions of any state in the South. The overwhelming number of victims were black and male.[21]\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\'s tomb, on the grounds of Atlanta\'s urban Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park\nAn Atlanta-born Baptist minister who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta\'s African-American community, Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a national leader in the civil rights movement. King joined with others to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957 to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South. The civil rights riots of the 1956 Sugar Bowl would also take place in Atlanta after a clash between Georgia Tech\'s president Blake R. Van Leer and Governor Marvin Griffin.[22]\nOn February 5, 1958, during a training mission flown by a B-47, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee Bomb, was lost off the coast of Tybee Island near Savannah. The bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried in silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound.[23]\nBy the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28 percent of the state\'s population, after waves of migration to the North and some immigration by whites.[20] Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor Carl Sanders worked with the Kennedy administration to ensure the state\'s compliance. Ralph McGill, editor and syndicated columnist at the Atlanta Constitution, earned admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, newly elected Governor Jimmy Carter declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended. In 1972, Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African American Congressman since the Reconstruction era.[citation needed]\nIn 1980 construction was completed on an expansion of what is now named Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than a hundred million passengers annually.[24] Employing more than 60,000 people, the airport became a major engine for economic growth.[24]\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Georgia (U.S. state)\nRoad to Brasstown Bald\nJekyll Island\nOkefenokee Swamp\nBoundaries[edit]\nBeginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state\'s eastern border with South Carolina runs up the Savannah River, northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Seneca Rivers. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the Chattooga River, its most significant tributary. These bounds were decided in the 1797 Treaty of Beaufort, and tested in the U.S. Supreme Court in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.[citation needed]\nThe border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County, at latitude 35Â°N, though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey, conducted in 1818).[25] This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia\'s territory presently comprising Alabama and Mississippi.[26]\nThe state\'s western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of Chattanooga, to meet the Chattahoochee River near West Point. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming Florida\'s Apalachicola River); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary\'s River, which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.[citation needed]\nThe water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint point now under Lake Seminole.[citation needed]\nAn 1818 survey erroneously placed Georgia\'s border with Tennessee one mile (1.6 km) south of the intended location of the 35th parallel north.[25] State legislators still dispute this placement, as correction of this inaccuracy would allow Georgia access to water from the Tennessee River.[27]\n\nGeology and terrain[edit]\nMain article: Geology of Georgia (U.S. state)\nUSGS map of Georgia elevations\nGeorgia consists of five principal physiographic regions: The Cumberland Plateau, Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, Blue Ridge Mountains, Piedmont, and the Atlantic coastal plain.[28] Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the region, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal.\n\nEcology[edit]\nMain article: Ecology of Georgia\nThe state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia\'s native trees include red cedar, a variety of pines, oaks, hollies, cypress, sweetgum, scaly-bark and white hickories, and sabal palmetto. East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions. Yellow jasmine and mountain laurel make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state.\nWhite-tailed deer are found in nearly all counties of Georgia. The northern mockingbird and brown thrasher are among the 160 bird species that live in the state.\nReptiles include the eastern diamondback, copperhead, and cottonmouth snakes as well as alligators; amphibians include salamanders, frogs and toads. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia. The Argentine black and white tegu is currently an invasive species in Georgia. It poses a problem to local wildlife by chasing down and killing many native species and dominating habitats.[29]\nThe most popular freshwater game fish are trout, bream, bass, and catfish, all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, and tarpon. Porpoises, whales, shrimp, oysters, and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.\n\nClimate[edit]\nMain article: Climate of Georgia (U.S. state)\nKÃ¶ppen climate classification types of Georgia\nImage of March 1993 Storm of the Century covering the length of the east coast; the outline of Georgia is discernible in the center of the image\nThe majority of the state is primarily a humid subtropical climate. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the North Georgia mountains, receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45 inches (1,100 mm) in central Georgia[30] to approximately 75 inches (1,900 mm) around the northeast part of the state.[31] The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico, and the elevation. The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4,500 feet (1,400 m) above sea level. The USDA plant hardiness zones for Georgia range from zone 6b (no colder than âˆ’5 Â°F (âˆ’21 Â°C)) in the Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (no colder than 15 Â°F (âˆ’9 Â°C) ) along the Atlantic coast and Florida border.[32]\nThe highest temperature ever recorded is 112 Â°F (44 Â°C) in Louisville on July 24, 1952,[33] while the lowest is âˆ’17 Â°F (âˆ’27 Â°C) in northern Floyd County on 27 January 1940.[34] Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of tornadoes, though they are rarely stronger than EF1. Although tornadoes striking the city are very rare,[35] an EF2 tornado[35] hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings. With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the Florida Panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rain to the interior, a recent example being Hurricane Michael.[36]\n\n\nMonthly average daily high and low temperatures for major Georgia cities\n\n\nCity\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\n\nAthens\n\n51/1133/1\n\n56/1335/2\n\n65/1842/6\n\n73/2349/9\n\n80/2758/14\n\n87/3165/18\n\n90/3269/21\n\n88/3168/20\n\n82/2863/17\n\n73/2351/11\n\n63/1742/6\n\n54/1235/2\n\n\nAtlanta\n\n52/1134/1\n\n57/1436/2\n\n65/1844/7\n\n73/2350/10\n\n80/2760/16\n\n86/3067/19\n\n89/3271/22\n\n88/3170/21\n\n82/2864/18\n\n73/2353/12\n\n63/1744/7\n\n55/1336/2\n\n\nAugusta\n\n56/1333/1\n\n61/1636/4\n\n69/2142/6\n\n77/2548/9\n\n84/2957/14\n\n90/3265/18\n\n92/3370/21\n\n90/3268/20\n\n85/2962/17\n\n76/2450/10\n\n68/2041/5\n\n59/1535/2\n\n\nColumbus\n\n57/1437/3\n\n62/1739/4\n\n69/2146/8\n\n76/2452/11\n\n83/2861/16\n\n90/3269/21\n\n92/3372/22\n\n91/3272/22\n\n86/3066/19\n\n77/2554/12\n\n68/2046/8\n\n59/1539/4\n\n\nMacon\n\n57/1434/1\n\n61/1637/3\n\n68/2044/7\n\n76/2450/10\n\n83/2859/15\n\n90/3267/19\n\n92/3370/21\n\n90/3270/21\n\n85/2964/18\n\n77/2551/11\n\n68/2042/6\n\n59/1536/2\n\n\nSavannah\n\n60/1638/3\n\n64/1841/5\n\n71/2248/9\n\n78/2653/12\n\n84/2961/16\n\n90/3268/20\n\n92/3372/22\n\n90/3271/22\n\n86/3067/19\n\n78/2656/13\n\n70/2147/8\n\n63/1740/4\n\n\nTemperatures are given in Â°F/Â°C format, with highs on top of lows.[37]\n\nDue to anthropogenic climate change, the climate of Georgia is warming. This is already causing major disruption, for example, from sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable to it than many other states because its land is sinking) and further warming will increase it.[38][39][40][41]\n\nMajor cities[edit]\nMain article: List of metropolitan areas in Georgia (U.S. state)\nAtlanta, located in north-central Georgia at the Eastern Continental Divide, has been Georgia\'s capital city since 1868. It is the most populous city in Georgia, with a 2020 U.S. census population of just over 498,000.[42] The state has seventeen cities with populations over 50,000, based on official 2020 U.S. census data.[42]\nAlong with the rest of the Southeast, Georgia\'s population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas. The U.S. Census Bureau lists fourteen metropolitan areas in the state. The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area added 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta rose in rank from the eleventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States to the ninth-largest.[43] The Atlanta metropolitan area is the cultural and economic center of the Southeastern United States. Its official population in 2020 was over 6 million, or 57 percent of Georgia\'s total population.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n   Largest cities or towns in Georgia2020 U.S. census populations\n\n\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\n\n\n\nAtlantaColumbus\n\n1\nAtlanta\nFulton, DeKalb\n498,715\n\nAugustaMacon\n\n\n2\nColumbus\nMuscogee\n206,922\n\n\n3\nAugusta\nRichmond\n202,081\n\n\n4\nMacon\nBibb\n157,346\n\n\n5\nSavannah\nChatham\n147,780\n\n\n6\nAthens\nClarke\n127,315\n\n\n7\nSandy Springs\nFulton\n108,080\n\n\n8\nSouth Fulton\nFulton\n107,436\n\n\n9\nRoswell\nCobb, Fulton\n92,833\n\n\n10\nJohns Creek\nFulton\n82,453\n\n\nDemographics[edit]\nMain article: Demographics of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n179082,548â€”1800162,68697.1%1810251,40754.5%1820340,98935.6%1830516,82351.6%1840691,39233.8%1850906,18531.1%18601,057,28616.7%18701,184,10912.0%18801,542,18130.2%18901,837,35319.1%19002,216,33120.6%19102,609,12117.7%19202,895,83211.0%19302,908,5060.4%19403,123,7237.4%19503,444,57810.3%19603,943,11614.5%19704,589,57516.4%19805,463,10519.0%19906,478,21618.6%20008,186,45326.4%20109,687,65318.3%202010,711,90810.6%2023 (est.)11,029,2273.0%1910â€“2022[45][46]\n\nPacked circles diagram showing estimates of the ethnic origins of people in Georgia in 2021\nMap of counties in Georgia by racial plurality, per the 2020 U.S. censusshow Legend     Non-Hispanic White   30â€“40%   40â€“50%   50â€“60%   60â€“70%   70â€“80%   80â€“90%   90%+   Black or African American   40â€“50%   50â€“60%   60â€“70%   70â€“80%   \nPopulation density by census tract in the state of Georgia, 2018\nThe United States Census Bureau reported Georgia\'s official population to be 10,711,908 as of the 2020 United States census.

That gave Georgia the greatest percentage increase among the 10 states with the biggest undocumented immigrant populations during those years.[48] Georgia has banned sanctuary cities.[49]\nIn 2018, The top countries of origin for Georgia\'s immigrants were Mexico, India, Jamaica, Korea, and Guatemala.[50]\nThere were 743,000 veterans in 2009.[51]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 10,689 homeless people in Georgia.[52][53]\n\nRace and ethnicity[edit]\n\nEthnic composition as of the 2020 census\n\n\nRace and ethnicity[54]\n\nAlone\n\nTotal\n\n\nWhite (non-Hispanic)\n\n50.1%\n\n50.1 \n\n53.2%\n\n53.2 \n\n\nAfrican American (non-Hispanic)\n\n30.6%\n\n30.6 \n\n32.3%\n\n32.3 \n\n\nHispanic or Latino\n\nâ€”\n\n\n\n10.5%\n\n10.5 \n\n\nAsian\n\n4.4%\n\n4.4 \n\n5.2%\n\n5.2 \n\n\nNative American\n\n0.2%\n\n0.2 \n\n1.5%\n\n1.5 \n\n\nPacific Islander\n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n\nOther\n\n0.5%\n\n0.5 \n\n1.2%\n\n1.2 \n\n\nHistorical racial demographics\nhide\n\nRacial composition\n1990[55]\n2000[56]\n2010[57]\n2020[58]\n\n\nWhite\n71.0%\n65.1%\n59.7%\n51.9%\n\n\nBlack\n27.0%\n28.7%\n30.5%\n31.0%\n\n\nAsian\n1.2%\n2.1%\n3.3%\n4.5%\n\n\nNative\n0.2%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.5%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander\nâ€”\n0.1%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n\n\nOther race\n0.6%\n2.4%\n4.0%\n5.2%\n\n\nTwo or more races\nâ€”\n1.4%\n2.1%\n6.9%\n\nIn the 1980 census, 1,584,303 people from Georgia claimed English ancestry out of a total state population of 3,994,817, making them 40% of the state, and the largest ethnic group at the time.[59] Today, many of these same people claiming they are of \"American\" ancestry are actually of English descent, and some are of Scots-Irish descent; however, their families have lived in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify simply as having \"American\" ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim \"American\" ancestry, though they are of predominantly English ancestry.[60][61][62][63]\nHistorically, about half of Georgia\'s population was composed of African Americans who, before the American Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African American population.[64]\nGeorgia had the second-fastest-growing Asian population growth in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, more than doubling in size during the ten-year period.[65] Indian people and Chinese people are the largest Asian groups in Georgia.[66] In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and third in numeric Black population after New York and Florida. Georgia also has a sizeable Latino population. Many are of Mexican descent.[67]\nGeorgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 12.8 percent (as of 2015[update]).[68]\nThe colonial settlement of large numbers of Scottish American, English American and Scotch-Irish Americans in the mountains and Piedmont, and coastal settlement by some English Americans and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state\'s culture in food, language and music. The concentration of African slaves repeatedly \"imported\" to coastal areas in the 18th century from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which many African traditions of food, religion and culture were retained.

Atlanta is a global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, as a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system.\nFor the five years through November 2017, Georgia has been ranked the top state (number 1) in the nation to do business, and has been recognized as number 1 for business and labor climate in the nation, number 1 in business climate in the nation, number 1 in the nation in workforce training and as having a \"Best in Class\" state economic development agency.[90][91]\nIn 2016, Georgia had a median annual income per person of between $50,000 and $59,999, which is in inflation-adjusted dollars for 2016. The U.S. median annual income for the entire nation is $57,617. This lies within the range of Georgia\'s median annual income.[92]\nA 2024 study listed Georgia in the top 20 of states for an affordable cost of living.[93]\n\nAgriculture[edit]\nA cotton field in southern Georgia\nWidespread farms produce peanuts, corn, and soybeans across middle and south Georgia. The state is the number one producer of pecans in the world, thanks to Naomi Chapman Woodroof regarding peanut breeding, with the region around Albany in southwest Georgia being the center of Georgia\'s pecan production. Gainesville in northeast Georgia touts itself as the Poultry Capital of the World. Georgia is in the top five blueberry producers in the United States.[94]\n\nMining[edit]\nSee also: List of gold mines in Georgia, Georgia Gold Belt, and Georgia Gold Rush\nReverse of the U.S. State Quarter for Georgia\nMajor products in the mineral industry include a variety of clays, stones, sands and the clay palygorskite, known as attapulgite.\n\nIndustry[edit]\nWhile many textile jobs moved overseas, there is still a textile industry located around the cities of Rome, Columbus, Augusta, Macon and along the I-75 corridor between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Historically it started along the fall line in the Piedmont, where factories were powered by waterfalls and rivers. It includes the towns of Cartersville, Calhoun, Ringgold and Dalton[95]\nIn November 2009, the South Korean automaker Kia Corporation began production in Georgia. The first Kia plant built in the U.S., Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, is located in West Point.

The Georgia Bulldogs and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have a historical rivalry in college football known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, and the Georgia State Panthers and the Georgia Southern Eagles have recently developed their own rivalry.\nThe 1996 Summer Olympics took place in Atlanta. The stadium that was built to host various Olympic events was converted to Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves through 2016. Atlanta will serve as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[123]\nAtlanta\'s Georgia Dome hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. The dome has hosted the NCAA Final Four Men\'s Basketball National Championship in 2002, 2007, and 2013.[124] It hosted WWE\'s WrestleMania XXVII in 2011, an event which set an attendance record of 71,617.

As of 2013[update], all but 19 of 181 boards are elected from single-member districts. Residents and activist groups in Fayette County sued the board of commissioners and school board for maintaining an election system based on at-large voting, which tended to increase the power of the majority and effectively prevented minority participation on elected local boards for nearly 200 years.[129] A change to single-member districts has resulted in the African-American minority being able to elect representatives of its choice.\nGeorgia high schools (grades nine through twelve) are required to administer a standardized, multiple choice End of Course Test, or EOCT, in each of eight core subjects: algebra, geometry, U.S. history, economics, biology, physical science, ninth grade literature and composition, and American literature. The official purpose of the tests is to assess \"specific content knowledge and skills\". Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive credit in the course, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score accounts for 15% of a student\'s grade in the course.[130] The Georgia Milestone evaluation is taken by public school students in the state.[131] In 2020, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia State BOE agreed to state superintendent Richard Woods\' proposal to change the weight of the EOCT test to only count for 0.01% of the Student\'s course grade. This change is currently only in effect for the 2020â€“21 school year.[132]\n\nOne of the entrances to the University of Georgia\nGeorgia has 85 public colleges, universities, and technical colleges in addition to more than 45 private institutes of higher learning. Among Georgia\'s public universities is the flagship research university, the University of Georgia, founded in 1785 as the country\'s oldest state-chartered university and the birthplace of the American system of public higher education.[133] The University System of Georgia is the presiding body over public post-secondary education in the state. The System includes 29 institutions of higher learning and is governed by the Georgia Board of Regents. Georgia\'s workforce of more than 6.3 million is constantly refreshed by the growing number of people who move there along with the 90,000 graduates from the universities, colleges and technical colleges across the state, including the highly ranked University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University and Emory University.[134]\nThe HOPE Scholarship, funded by the state lottery, is available to all Georgia residents who have graduated from high school or earned a General Educational Development certificate. The student must maintain a 3.0 or higher grade point average and attend a public college or university in the state.[135]\nThe Georgia Historical Society, an independent educational and research institution, has a research center located in Savannah. The research center\'s library and archives hold the oldest collection of materials related to Georgia history in the nation.\n\nMedia[edit]\nSee also: List of newspapers in Georgia (U.S. state)\nThe CNN Center in Atlanta\nThe Atlanta metropolitan area is the ninth largest media market in the United States as ranked by Nielsen Media Research. The state\'s other top markets are Savannah (95th largest), Augusta (115th largest), and Columbus (127th largest).[136]\nThere are 48 television broadcast stations in Georgia including TBS, TNT, TCM, Cartoon Network, CNN and Headline News, all founded by notable Georgia resident Ted Turner. The Weather Channel also has its headquarters in Atlanta.\nBy far, the largest daily newspaper in Georgia is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution with a daily readership of 195,592 and a Sunday readership of 397,925.[137][138] Other large dailies include The Augusta Chronicle, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, The Telegraph (formerly The Macon Telegraph) and the Savannah Morning News.\nWSB-AM in Atlanta was the first licensed radio station in the southeastern United States, signing on in 1922. Georgia Public Radio has been in service since 1984[139][140] and, with the exception of Atlanta, it broadcasts daily on several FM (and one AM) stations across the state. Georgia Public Radio reaches nearly all of Georgia (with the exception of the Atlanta area, which is served by WABE).\nWSB-TV in Atlanta is the state\'s oldest television station, having begun operations in 1948. WSB the first television service in Georgia, and the South.[141]\n\nGovernment[edit]\nMain article: Government of Georgia (U.S. state)\nState government[edit]\nSee also: List of governors of Georgia and Georgia elected officials\nThe Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, with the distinctive gold dome\nSavannah City Hall\nAs with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Georgia\'s government is based on the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power.[142] Executive authority in the state rests with the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican). Both the Governor of Georgia and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor\'s cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor.\nLegislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.[143] The laws enacted by the General Assembly are codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.\nState judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority.[144] In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including Superior Courts, State Courts, Juvenile Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state\'s citizens who live within that court\'s jurisdiction.\n\nLocal government[edit]\nFurther information: List of counties in Georgia and List of municipalities in Georgia\nGeorgia consists of 159 counties, second only to Texas, with 254.[145] Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931, when Milton and Campbell were merged into the existing Fulton. Some counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many bear names with Native American origin. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.[146] Several counties have a sole Commissioner form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with current Sole Commissioner counties. Georgia\'s Constitution provides all counties and cities with \"home rule\" authority. The county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county, as a municipality would.\nGeorgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities, though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships;[147] it does allow consolidated city-county governments by local referendum. All of Georgia\'s second-tier cities except Savannah have now formed consolidated city-county governments by referendum: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995), and Macon (2012). (Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small, incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries.) The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after it merged with unincorporated Chattahoochee County in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, the town of Georgetown consolidated with the rest of Quitman County.\nThere is no true metropolitan government in Georgia, though the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and Georgia Regional Transportation Authority do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major land development projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area. [citation needed]\n\nElections[edit]\nMain article: Elections in Georgia (U.S. state)\nSee also: Political party strength in Georgia (U.S. state)\nGeorgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a streak that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020.[148]\nUntil 1964, Georgia\'s state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, of any state in the Union. This record was established largely due to the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.[149]\nWhite Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.[150] In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state\'s population.[151]\nThe whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or own at least forty acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanishâ€“American War was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because, by 1908, many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.[150][152] In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate.[19] White one-party rule was solidified.\nFor more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly.[153] Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats, who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards.[154][155] This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period.[156]\nLegal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia\'s population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.[157]\nIn 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue, a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.\nEven before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only four times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state; and in 2020, Joe Biden narrowly carried the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.[158] Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman Larry McDonald, former head of the John Birch Society, who died when the Soviet Union shot down KAL 007 near Sakhalin Island. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,[158] as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.\nThe ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia U.S. House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.\nIn 2008, Democrat Jim Martin ran against incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the runoff election held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.\nIn the 2018 elections, the governorship remained under control by a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a Democrat, Stacey Abrams), Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the Georgia Senate (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat U.S. Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).[159][160][161]\nIn the three presidential elections up to and including 2016, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. This trend led to the state narrowly electing Democrat Joe Biden for president in 2020, and it coming to be regarded as a swing state.[162][163]\nIn a 2020 study, Georgia was ranked as 49th on the \"Cost of Voting Index\" with only Texas ranking higher.[164] In 2022, Georgia swung substantially back to the right towards Republicans with incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp winning reelection by 7.5% over Democrat Stacey Abrams with a raw vote margin of over 300,000 votes in the 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election. The largest amount since the early 2000s, and every other Republican statewide getting elected by a 5â€“10% margin of victory.[citation needed]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta\'s, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.\nA related case, Reynolds v. Sims (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of \"one man, one vote\"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.[165] From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans\' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law.\nEconomic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging \"New South\". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.\nIn the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor Zell Miller, decided to support Republicans. The state\'s then-socially conservative bent resulted in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages was approved by 76% of voters.[166] However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, all Georgia counties came into full compliance, recognizing the rights of same-sex couples to marry in the state.[167]\nIn presidential elections, Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from 1900 to 1960. In 1964, it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater over Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968, it did not vote for either of the two parties, but rather the American Independent Party and its nominee, Alabama Governor George Wallace. In 1972, the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for Richard Nixon. In 1976 and 1980, it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. The state returned to Republicans in 1984 and 1988, before going Democratic once again in 1992. For every election between that year and 2020, Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the Deep South. In 2020, it voted Democratic for the first time in 28 years, aiding Joe Biden in his defeat of incumbent Republican Donald Trump.\nPrior to 2020, Republicans in state, federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory, and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a \"toss-up\" state, or with Biden as a very narrow favorite.[168] Concurrent with the 2020 presidential election were two elections for both of Georgia\'s United States Senate seats (one of which being a special election due to the resignation of Senator Johnny Isakson, and the other being regularly scheduled). After no candidate in either race received a majority of the vote, both went to January 5, 2021, run-offs, which Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won. Ossoff is the state\'s first Jewish senator, and Warnock is the state\'s first Black senator. Biden\'s, Ossoff\'s, and Warnock\'s wins were attributed to the rapid diversification of the suburbs of Atlanta[169] and increased turnout of younger African American voters, particularly around the suburbs of Atlanta and in Savannah, Georgia.[170][171][172]\n\nParks and recreational activities[edit]\nMain article: Protected areas of Georgia (U.S. state)\nThere are 48 state parks, 15 historic sites, and numerous wildlife preserves under supervision of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.[173] Other historic sites and parks are supervised by the National Park Service and include the Andersonville National Historic Site in Andersonville; Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area near Atlanta; Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park at Fort Oglethorpe; Cumberland Island National Seashore near St. Marys; Fort Frederica National Monument on St. Simons Island; Fort Pulaski National Monument in Savannah; Jimmy Carter National Historic Site near Plains; Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park near Kennesaw; Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta; Ocmulgee National Monument at Macon; Trail of Tears National Historic Trail; and the Okefenokee Swamp in Waycross, Georgia[174]\nOutdoor recreational activities include hiking along the Appalachian Trail; Civil War Heritage Trails; rock climbing and whitewater kayaking.[175][176][177][178] Other outdoor activities include hunting and fishing.\n\nTransportation[edit]\nMain article: Transportation in Georgia (U.S. state)\nThe Port of Brunswick and the Sidney Lanier Bridge\nTransportation in Georgia is overseen by the Georgia Department of Transportation, a part of the executive branch of the state government. Georgia\'s major Interstate Highways are I-20, I-75, I-85, and I-95. On 18 March 1998 the Georgia House of Representatives passed a resolution naming the portion of Interstate 75, which runs from the Chattahoochee River northward to the Tennessee state line the Larry McDonald Memorial Highway. Larry McDonald, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, had been on Korean Air Lines Flight 007 when it was shot down by the Soviets on 1 September 1983.\n\nMARTA (rapid transit) train\nGeorgia\'s primary commercial airport is Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), the world\'s busiest airport.[179] In addition to Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson, there are eight other airports serving major commercial traffic in Georgia. Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the state as measured by passengers served, and is the only additional international airport. Other commercial airports (ranked in order of passengers served) are located in Augusta, Columbus, Albany, Macon, Brunswick, Valdosta, and Athens.[180]\nThe Georgia Ports Authority manages two deepwater seaports, at Savannah and Brunswick, and two river ports, at Bainbridge and Columbus. The Port of Savannah is a major U.S. seaport on the Atlantic coast.[citation needed]\nThe Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is the principal rapid transit system in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Formed in 1971 as strictly a bus system, MARTA operates a network of bus routes linked to a rapid transit system consisting of 48 miles (77 km) of rail track with 38 train stations. MARTA operates almost exclusively in Fulton and DeKalb counties, with bus service to two destinations in Cobb county and the Cumberland Transfer Center next to the Cumberland Mall, and a single rail station in Clayton County at Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport. MARTA also operates a separate paratransit service for disabled customers. As of 2009[update], the average total daily ridership for the system (bus and rail) was 482,500 passengers.[181]\n\nHealth care[edit]\nMain article: List of hospitals in Georgia (U.S. state)\nThe state has 151 general hospitals, more than 15,000 doctors and almost 6,000 dentists.[182] The state is ranked forty-first in the percentage of residents who engage in regular exercise.[183]\n\nNotable people[edit]\nMain article: List of people from Georgia (U.S. state)\nJimmy Carter, from Plains, Georgia, was President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta in 1929. He was a civil rights movement leader who protested for equal rights and against racial discrimination. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.[184] Blake R. Van Leer played an important role in the civil rights movement, Georgia\'s economy and was president of Georgia Tech.[185] Mordecai Sheftall, the highest ranking Jewish officer in the American Revolution, was born and lived his life in Georgia.[186] Naomi Chapman Woodruff, originally from Idaho, was responsible for developing a peanut breeding program in Georgia which lead to a harvest of nearly five times the typical amount.[187]\n\nState symbols[edit]\nRosa laevigata (Cherokee rose), the state flower\nQuercus virginiana (Live oak), the state tree at Valdosta State University\nAmphibian: American green tree frog\nBird: brown thrasher\nCrop: peanut\nFish: largemouth bass\nFlower: Cherokee rose\nFruit: peach\nGem: quartz\nInsect: honey bee\nMammal: white-tailed deer[188]\nMarine mammal: right whale\nMineral: staurolite\nNicknames:\n\"Peach State\"\n\"Empire State of the South\"[189]\nReptile: gopher tortoise\nSong: \"Georgia on My Mind\"\nTree: live oak\nVegetable: Vidalia onion\nReference: Georgia Symbols[190]\nSee also[edit]\nIndex of Georgia (U.S. state)-related articles\nOutline of Georgia (U.S. state)\nUSS Georgia, 2 ships\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Georgia State Symbols :: Capitol Museum, Atlanta :: University of Georgia\".

It was developed in the 4th century AD by Ulfilas (or Wulfila), a Gothic preacher of Cappadocian Greek descent, for the purpose of translating the Bible.[1]\nThe alphabet essentially uses uncial forms of the Greek alphabet, with a few additional letters to express Gothic phonology:\n\nLatin F and G\na questionably Runic letter to distinguish the /w/ glide from vocalic /u/\nthe letter hwair (Æ•) to express the Gothic labiovelar.\n\nOrigin[edit]\nUlfilas is thought to have consciously chosen to avoid the use of the older Runic alphabet for this purpose, as it was heavily connected with pagan beliefs and customs.[2] Also, the Greek-based script probably helped to integrate the Gothic nation into the dominant Greco-Roman culture around the Black Sea.[3]\n\nLetters[edit]\nBelow is a table of the Gothic alphabet.[4] Two letters used in its transliteration are not used in current English: thorn Ã¾ (representing /Î¸/), and hwair Æ• (representing /hÊ·/).\nAs with the Greek alphabet, Gothic letters were also assigned numerical values. When used as numerals, letters were written either between two dots (â€¢ğŒ¹ğŒ±â€¢ = 12) or with an overline (ğŒ¹ğŒ± = 12). Two letters, ğ (90) and ğŠ (900), have no phonetic value.\nThe letter names are recorded in a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795).

These are:\n\nğŒµ (q; derived either from a form of Greek stigma/digamma (),[8] or from a cursive variant of kappa (Ï°), which could strongly resemble a u,[8] or by inverting Greek pi (ğ€) /p/, perhaps due to similarity in the Gothic names: pairÃ¾a versus qairÃ¾a[citation needed])\nğŒ¸ (Ã¾; derived either from Greek phi (Î¦) /f/ or psi (Î¨) /ps/ with phonetic reassignment, or Runic áš¦)[9]\nğŒ¾ (j; derived from Latin G /É¡/[8])\nğŒ¿ (u; possibly an allograph of Greek ÎŸ (cf. the numerical values), or from Runic áš¢ /u/)[10]\nğˆ (Æ•; derived from Greek Î˜ /Î¸/ with phonetic reassignment; possibly the letterform was switched with ğŒ¸)[8]\nğ‰ (o; derived either from Greek Î© or from Runic á›Ÿ,[11] or from a cursive form of Greek ÎŸ, as such a form was more common for omicron than for omega in this time period, and as the sound values of omicron and omega had already merged by this time.[8])\nğ‚ (r), ğƒ (s) and ğ† (f) appear to be derived from their Latin equivalents rather than from the Greek, although the equivalent Runic letters (áš±, á›‹ and áš ), assumed to have been part of the Gothic futhark, possibly played some role in this choice.[12] However, SnÃ¦dal claims that \"Wulfila\'s knowledge of runes was questionable to say the least\", as the paucity of inscriptions attests that knowledge and use of runes was rare among the East Germanic peoples.[8] Some variants of ğƒ (s) are shaped like a sigma and more obviously derive from the Greek Î£.[8]\nğ‡ (x) is only used in proper names and loanwords containing Greek Î§  (xristus \"Christ\", galiugaxristus \"Pseudo-Christ\", zaxarias \"Zacharias\", aiwxaristia \"eucharist\").[13]\nRegarding the letters\' numeric values, most correspond to those of the Greek numerals. Gothic ğŒµ takes the place of Ïœ (6), ğŒ¾ takes the place of Î¾ (60), ğŒ¿ that of ÎŸ (70), and ğˆ that of Ïˆ (700).\n\nDiacritics and punctuation[edit]\nDiacritics and punctuation used in the Codex Argenteus include a trema placed on  ğŒ¹ i, transliterated as Ã¯, in general applied to express diaeresis, the interpunct (Â·) and colon (:) as well as overlines to indicate sigla (such as xaus for xristaus) and numerals.\n\nUnicode[edit]\nThe Gothic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2001 with the release of version 3.1.\nThe Unicode block for Gothic is U+10330â€“ U+1034F in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane. As older software that uses UCS-2 (the predecessor of UTF-16) assumes that all Unicode codepoints can be expressed as 16 bit numbers (U+FFFF or lower, the Basic Multilingual Plane), problems may be encountered using the Gothic alphabet Unicode range and others outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane.\n\n\n\nGothic[1][2]Official Unicode Consortium code chart (PDF)\n\n\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n\n\nU+1033x\n\nğŒ°\n\nğŒ±\n\nğŒ²\n\nğŒ³\n\nğŒ´\n\nğŒµ\n\nğŒ¶\n\nğŒ·\n\nğŒ¸\n\nğŒ¹\n\nğŒº\n\nğŒ»\n\nğŒ¼\n\nğŒ½\n\nğŒ¾\n\nğŒ¿\n\n\nU+1034x\n\nğ€\n\nğ\n\nğ‚\n\nğƒ\n\nğ„\n\nğ…\n\nğ†\n\nğ‡\n\nğˆ\n\nğ‰\n\nğŠ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n1.^ As of Unicode version 15.1\n2.^ Grey areas indicate non-assigned code points\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ According to the testimony of the historians Philostorgius, Socrates of Constantinople and Sozomen.

It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records.[10] Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years;[11][12] previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary.[13] The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.\nThe Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek.[14][15] Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.\nDuring antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world.[16] It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek.[17] In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora.\nGreek roots have been widely used for centuries and continue to be widely used to coin new words in other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.\n\nIdealised portrayal of the author Homer\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Greek\nGreek has been spoken in the Balkan peninsula since around the 3rd millennium BC,[18] or possibly earlier.[19] The earliest written evidence is a Linear B clay tablet found in Messenia that dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC,[20] making Greek the world\'s oldest recorded living language.[21] Among the Indo-European languages, its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now-extinct Anatolian languages.\n\nPeriods[edit]\nProto-Greek-speaking area according to linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev\nThe Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:\n\nProto-Greek: the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the Greek peninsula sometime in the Neolithic era or the Bronze Age.[note 2]\nMycenaean Greek: the language of the Mycenaean civilization. It is recorded in the Linear B script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.\nAncient Greek: in its various dialects, the language of the Archaic and Classical periods of the ancient Greek civilization. It was widely known throughout the Roman Empire. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in Western Europe in the Middle Ages but remained officially in use in the Byzantine world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the Fall of Constantinople and Greek migration to western Europe.\nKoine Greek (also known as Hellenistic Greek): The fusion of Ionian with Attic, the dialect of Athens, began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of Alexander the Great; after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from Egypt to the fringes of India. After the Roman conquest of Greece, an unofficial bilingualism of Greek and Latin was established in the city of Rome and Koine Greek became the first or second language in the Roman Empire. The origin of Christianity can also be traced through Koine Greek because the Apostles used this form of the language to spread Christianity. Because it was the original language of the New Testament, and the Old Testament was translated into it as the Septuagint, that variety of Koine Greek may be referred to as New Testament Greek or sometimes Biblical Greek.\nDistribution of varieties of Greek in Anatolia, 1910. Demotic in yellow. Pontic in orange. Cappadocian Greek in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek villages.[24]\nMedieval Greek (also known as Byzantine Greek): the continuation of Koine Greek up to the demise of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century. Medieval Greek is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching Modern Greek in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\nModern Greek (also known as Neo-Hellenic):[25] Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several dialects of it.\nDiglossia[edit]\nMain article: Greek language question\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of diglossia: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the Greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of Modern Greek: Dimotiki, the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and Katharevousa, meaning \'purified\', a compromise between Dimotiki and Ancient Greek developed in the early 19th century that was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, after having incorporated features of Katharevousa and thus giving birth to Standard Modern Greek, used today for all official purposes and in education.[26]\n\nHistorical unity[edit]\nThe distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language are often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.[27] It is also often[citation needed] stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, \"Homeric Greek is probably closer to Demotic than 12-century Middle English is to modern spoken English\".[28]\n\nGeographic distribution[edit]\nFurther information: Greeks and Greek diaspora\nGeographic distribution of Greek language in the Russian Empire (1897 census)\nGreek is spoken today by at least 13 million people, principally in Greece and Cyprus along with a sizable Greek-speaking minority in Albania near the Greek-Albanian border.[25] A significant percentage of Albania\'s population has  knowledge of the Greek language due in part to the Albanian wave of immigration to Greece in the 1980s and \'90s and the Greek community in the country. Prior to the Greco-Turkish War and the resulting population exchange in 1923 a very large population of Greek-speakers also existed in Turkey, though very few remain today.[10] A small Greek-speaking community is also found in Bulgaria near the Greek-Bulgarian border. Greek is also spoken worldwide by the sizable Greek diaspora which has notable communities in the United States, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and throughout the European Union, especially in Germany.\nHistorically, significant Greek-speaking communities and regions were found throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, in what are today Southern Italy, Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and Libya; in the area of the Black Sea, in what are today Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan; and, to a lesser extent, in the Western Mediterranean in and around colonies such as Massalia, Monoikos, and Mainake. It was also used as the official language of government and religion in the Christian Nubian kingdoms, for most of their history.[29]\n\nOfficial status[edit]\nGreek, in its modern form, is the official language of Greece, where it is spoken by almost the entire population.[30] It is also the official language of Cyprus (nominally alongside Turkish) and the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (alongside English).[31] Because of the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union, Greek is one of the organization\'s 24 official languages.[32] Greek is recognized as a minority language in Albania, and used co-officially in some of its municipalities, in the districts of Gjirokastër and Sarandë.[33] It is also an official minority language in the regions of Apulia and Calabria in Italy. In the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Greek is protected and promoted officially as a regional and minority language in Armenia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine.[34] It is recognized as a minority language and protected in Turkey by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.[4][5][6][7]\n\nCharacteristics[edit]\nSee also: Ancient Greek grammar, Koine Greek grammar, and Modern Greek grammar\nThe phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period. The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because, in all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\nPhonology[edit]\nMain articles: Modern Greek phonology, Koine Greek phonology, and Ancient Greek phonology\nDuration: 23 seconds.0:23Spoken Modern Greek\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see Koine Greek phonology for details):\n\nreplacement of the pitch accent with a stress accent.\nsimplification of the system of vowels and diphthongs: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a chain shift of vowels towards /i/ (iotacism).\ndevelopment of the voiceless aspirated plosives /pʰ/ and /tʰ/ to the voiceless fricatives /f/ and /θ/, respectively; the similar development of /kʰ/ to /x/ may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with φ, θ, and χ).\ndevelopment of the voiced plosives /b/, /d/, and /ɡ/ to their voiced fricative counterparts /β/ (later /v/), /ð/, and /ɣ/.\nMorphology[edit]\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding[35] and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future, and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by periphrastic (analytical) forms.\n\nNouns and adjectives[edit]\nPronouns show distinctions in person (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), number (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and decline for case (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).[note 3] Nouns, articles, and adjectives show all the distinctions except for a person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\nVerbs[edit]\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language\'s history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for:\n\n\n\n\n\nAncient Greek\n\nModern Greek\n\n\nPerson\n\nfirst, second and third\nalso second person formal\n\n\nNumber\n\nsingular, dual and plural\nsingular and plural\n\n\ntense\n\npresent, past and future\n\npast and non-past (future is expressed by a periphrastic construction)\n\n\naspect\n\nimperfective, perfective (traditionally called aorist) and perfect (sometimes also called perfective; see note about terminology)\n\nimperfective and perfective/aorist (perfect is expressed by a periphrastic construction)\n\n\nmood\n\nindicative, subjunctive, imperative and optative\n\nindicative, subjunctive,[note 4] and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n\n\nVoice\n\nactive, medio-passive, and passive\n\nactive and medio-passive\n\nSyntax[edit]\nMany aspects of the syntax of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (employing a raft of new periphrastic constructions instead) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\nVocabulary[edit]\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,[36] some documented in Mycenaean texts; they include a large number of Greek toponyms. The form and meaning of many words have changed. Loanwords (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from Latin, Venetian, and Turkish. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from French and English, are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from Albanian, South Slavic (Macedonian/Bulgarian) and Eastern Romance languages (Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian).\n\nLoanwords in other languages[edit]\nFurther information: English words of Greek origin and List of Greek and Latin roots in English\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English. Example words include: mathematics, physics, astronomy, democracy, philosophy, athletics, theatre, rhetoric, baptism, evangelist, etc. Moreover, Greek words and word elements continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: anthropology, photography, telephony, isomer, biomechanics, cinematography, etc. Together with Latin words, they form the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary; for example, all words ending in –logy (\"discourse\"). There are many English words of Greek origin.[37][38]\n\nClassification[edit]\nGreek is an independent branch of the Indo-European language family. The ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient Macedonian, which, by most accounts, was a distinct dialect of Greek itself.[39][40][41][42] Aside from the Macedonian question, current consensus regards Phrygian as the closest relative of Greek, since they share a number of phonological, morphological and lexical isoglosses, with some being exclusive between them.[39][43][44] Scholars have proposed a Graeco-Phrygian subgroup out of which Greek and Phrygian originated.[39][45][46][47]\nAmong living languages, some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to Armenian (see Graeco-Armenian) or the Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan), but little definitive evidence has been found.[48][49] In addition, Albanian has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and Armenian, and it has been proposed that they all form a higher-order subgroup along with other extinct languages of the ancient Balkans; this higher-order subgroup is usually termed Palaeo-Balkan, and Greek has a central position in it.[50][51]\n\nWriting system[edit]\nGreek alphabet\n Αα Alpha Νν Nu Ββ Beta Ξξ Xi Γγ Gamma Οο Omicron Δδ Delta Ππ Pi Εε Epsilon Ρρ Rho Ζζ Zeta Σσς Sigma Ηη Eta Ττ Tau Θθ Theta Υυ Upsilon Ιι Iota Φφ Phi Κκ Kappa Χχ Chi Λλ Lambda Ψψ Psi Μμ Mu Ωω Omega\n\nHistory\n Archaic local variants\nϜͰϺϘͲͶ tsandigamma \nDiacritics\nLigatures\n Numerals\nϛ (6)ϟ (90)ϡ (900) \n\nUse in other languages\nBactrian\nCoptic\nAlbanian\n\nRelated topics\nUse as scientific symbols\n\n\n Category\nvte\nSee also: Greek Braille\nLinear B[edit]\nMain article: Linear B\nLinear B, attested as early as the late 15th century BC, was the first script used to write Greek.[52] It is basically a syllabary, which was finally deciphered by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick in the 1950s (its precursor, Linear A, has not been deciphered and most likely encodes a non-Greek language).[52] The language of the Linear B texts, Mycenaean Greek, is the earliest known form of Greek.[52]\n\nCypriot syllabary[edit]\nMain article: Cypriot syllabary\nGreek inscription in Cypriot syllabic script\nAnother similar system used to write the Greek language was the Cypriot syllabary (also a descendant of Linear A via the intermediate Cypro-Minoan syllabary), which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences. The Cypriot syllabary is attested in Cyprus from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period, in favor of the standard Greek alphabet.[53]\n\nGreek alphabet[edit]\nMain articles: Greek alphabet and Greek orthography\nAncient epichoric variants of the Greek alphabet from Euboea, Ionia, Athens, and Corinth comparing to modern Greek\nGreek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC. It was created by modifying the Phoenician alphabet, with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late Ionic variant, introduced for writing classical Attic in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill.\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase (majuscule) and lowercase (minuscule) form. The letter sigma has an additional lowercase form (ς) used in the final position of a word:\n\n\n\nupper case\n\n\nΑ\nΒ\nΓ\nΔ\nΕ\nΖ\nΗ\nΘ\nΙ\nΚ\nΛ\nΜ\nΝ\nΞ\nΟ\nΠ\nΡ\nΣ\nΤ\nΥ\nΦ\nΧ\nΨ\nΩ\n\n\nlower case\n\n\nα\nβ\nγ\nδ\nε\nζ\nη\nθ\nι\nκ\nλ\nμ\nν\nξ\nο\nπ\nρ\nσς\nτ\nυ\nφ\nχ\nψ\nω\n\nDiacritics[edit]\nMain article: Greek diacritics\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs: three different accent marks (acute, grave, and circumflex), originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks (rough and smooth breathing), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the diaeresis, used to mark the full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in typography.\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of Ancient Greek.\n\nPunctuation[edit]\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (•), known as the ano teleia (άνω τελεία). In Greek the comma also functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing ό,τι (ó,ti, \'whatever\') from ότι (óti, \'that\').[54]\nAncient Greek texts often used scriptio continua (\'continuous writing\'), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries.[55] Boustrophedon, or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.\n\nLatin alphabet[edit]\nGreek has occasionally been written in the Latin script, especially in areas under Venetian rule or by Greek Catholics. The term Frankolevantinika / Φραγκολεβαντίνικα applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism (because Frankos / Φράγκος is an older Greek term for West-European dating to when most of (Roman Catholic Christian) West Europe was under the control of the Frankish Empire). Frankochiotika / Φραγκοχιώτικα (meaning \'Catholic Chiot\') alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios. Additionally, the term Greeklish is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications.[56]\nThe Latin script is nowadays used by the Greek-speaking communities of Southern Italy.\n\nHebrew alphabet[edit]\nThe Yevanic dialect was written by Romaniote and Constantinopolitan Karaite Jews using the Hebrew Alphabet.[57]\n\nArabic alphabet[edit]\nSome Greek Muslims from Crete wrote their Cretan Greek in the Arabic alphabet. The same happened among Epirote Muslims in Ioannina. This usage is sometimes called aljamiado, as when Romance languages are written in the Arabic alphabet.[58]\n\nExample text[edit]\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Greek:\n\nΌλοι οι άνθρωποι γεννιούνται ελεύθεροι και ίσοι στην αξιοπρέπεια και τα δικαιώματα.

In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak—or even know—the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (frangochiotika); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (karamanlidika); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (tourkogianniotika, tourkokretika). Our case is much stranger, since it is a quite early example for that kind of literature and because it is largely concerned with religious themes.\"; p. 306. The audience for the Greek Mi\'rājnāma was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called Tourkogianniotes (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek Aljamiado literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith. Given their low level of literacy, one important way that they could learn about their faith was to listen to religiously edifying texts such as the Greek Mi\'rājnāma.\n\n^ \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\". ohchr.org.\n\n^ \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\".

It borders Lake Michigan to its northeast, the Mississippi River to its west, and the Wabash and Ohio rivers to its south.[b] Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth-largest population, and the 25th-most land area. Its largest urban areas include Chicago and the Metro East of Greater St. Louis, as well as Peoria, Rockford, Champaignâ€“Urbana, and Springfield, the state\'s capital.\nIllinois has a highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast, major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. Owing to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. Chicago has been the nation\'s railroad hub since the 1860s,[6] and its O\'Hare International Airport has been among the world\'s busiest airports for decades. Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase Will it play in Peoria?.[7]\nPresent-day Illinois was inhabited by various indigenous cultures for thousands of years, including the advanced civilization centered in the Cahokia region. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi and Illinois River in the 17th century in the region they called Illinois Country, as part of the sprawling colony of New France. Following U.S. independence in 1783, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. Illinois was part of the United States\' oldest territory, the Northwest Territory, and in 1818 it achieved statehood. The Erie Canal brought increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes, and the small settlement of Chicago became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, benefiting from its location as one of the few natural harbors in southwestern Lake Michigan.[8] The invention of the self-scouring steel plow by Illinoisan John Deere turned the state\'s rich prairie into some of the world\'s most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. In the mid-19th century, the Illinois and Michigan Canal and a sprawling railroad network greatly facilitated trade, commerce, and settlement, making the state a transportation hub for the nation.[9]\nBy 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois became one of America\'s most industrialized states and remains a major manufacturing center.[10] The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans, particularly in Chicago, who founded the city\'s famous jazz and blues cultures.[11][12] Chicago became a leading cultural, economic, and population center and is today one of the world\'s major commercial centers; its metropolitan area, informally referred to as Chicagoland, holds about 65% of the state\'s 12.8 million residents. \nTwo World Heritage Sites are in Illinois, the ancient Cahokia Mounds, and part of the Wright architecture site. Major centers of learning include the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, and Northwestern University. A wide variety of protected areas seek to conserve Illinois\' natural and cultural resources. Historically, three U.S. presidents have been elected while residents of Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama; additionally, Ronald Reagan was born and raised in the state. Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan Land of Lincoln.[13][14] The state is the site of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield and the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.\n\n\nEtymology\nSee also: Illinois Confederation and List of counties in Illinois\n\"Illinois\" is the modern spelling for the early French Catholic missionaries and explorers\' name for the Illinois Native Americans, a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.[15]\nAmerican scholars previously thought the name Illinois meant \'man\' or \'men\' in the Miami-Illinois language, with the original iliniwek transformed via French into Illinois.[16][17] This etymology is not supported by the Illinois language,[citation needed] as the word for \"man\" is ireniwa, and plural of \"man\" is ireniwaki. The name Illiniwek has also been said to mean \'tribe of superior men\',[18] which is a false etymology. The name Illinois derives from the Miami-Illinois verb irenweÂ·wa \'he speaks the regular way\'. This was taken into the Ojibwe language, perhaps in the Ottawa dialect, and modified into ilinweÂ· (pluralized as ilinweÂ·k). The French borrowed these forms, spelling the /we/ ending as -ois, a transliteration of that sound in the French of that time. The current spelling form, Illinois, began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois\'s name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was Inoka, of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.[19][20]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Illinois\nPre-European\nMississippian copper plate found at the Saddle Site in Union County, Illinois\nAmerican Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and Urban Center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a 50-acre (20 ha) plaza larger than 35 football fields,[21] and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture\'s cosmology. Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest Pre-Columbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico. It is 100 ft (30 m) high, 951 ft (290 m) long, 836 ft (255 m) wide, and covers 13.8 acres (5.6 ha).[22] It contains about 814,000 cu yd (622,000 m3) of earth.[23] It was topped by a structure thought to have measured about 105 ft (32 m) in length and 48 ft (15 m) in width, covered an area 5,000 sq ft (460 m2), and been as much as 50 ft (15 m) high, making its peak 150 ft (46 m) above the level of the plaza. The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20,000 shell beads. These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making.[24]\nThe civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, \"At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries.\"[25] The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance.[26] As the Illini declined during the Beaver Wars era, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes including the Fox (Meskwaki), Iowa, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Piankeshaw, Shawnee, Wea, and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes.[27][28]\n\nEuropean exploration and settlement prior to 1800\nMain articles: New France; Louisiana (New France); Canada (New France); Illinois Country; French and Indian War; Treaty of Paris (1763); Province of Quebec (1763â€“1791); Indian Reserve (1763); American Revolutionary War; Western theater of the American Revolutionary War; Illinois County, Virginia; Treaty of Paris (1783); Northwest Ordinance; and Northwest Territory\nIllinois in 1718, approximate modern state area highlighted, from Carte de la Louisiane et du cours du Mississipi by Guillaume de L\'Isle[29]\nFrench explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois in Illinois Country. In 1680, French explorers under RenÃ©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed a fort at the site of present-day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today\'s Starved Rock State Park. French Empire Canadiens came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first New France, and then of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years\' War. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, Missouri, to evade British rule.[30]\nA few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the British Province of Quebec. In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed Illinois County for Virginia. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the Northwest Territory, administered by the federal government and later organized as states.[30]\n\n19th century\nMain articles: Indiana Territory, Organic act Â§ List of organic acts, Illinois Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\nSee also: History of Chicago and History of Nauvoo, Illinois\nPrior to statehood\nThe bell donated by King Louis XV in 1741 to the French mission at Kaskaskia. It was later called the \"Liberty Bell of the West\", after it was rung to celebrate U.S. victory in the Revolution\nThe Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement.\nDuring the discussions leading up to Illinois\'s admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.[31] The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10 mi (16 km) northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana\'s, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42Â° 30\' north, which is approximately 51 mi (82 km) north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added 8,500 sq mi (22,000 km2) to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.\n\nThe State of Illinois prior to the Civil War\nIn 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as the state of Illinois, and the rest was joined to Michigan Territory.\nOld State Capitol: Abraham Lincoln and other area legislators were instrumental in moving the state capitol to centrally located Springfield in 1839.\nIn 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield,[32] where a fifth capitol building was constructed. A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.\nThough it was ostensibly a \"free state\", there was nonetheless slavery in Illinois. The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state. As the southern part of the state, later known as \"Egypt\" or \"Little Egypt\",[33][34] was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks. Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor, but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal. Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.[35] The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.[36]\nThe winter of 1830â€“1831 is called the \"Winter of the Deep Snow\";[37] a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the \"Winter of the Sudden Freeze\". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name, \"Little Egypt\", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.[38]\nIn 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.[39] The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa.[40]\nBy 1839, the Latter Day Saints had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo, formerly called Commerce. Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished and, by 1844, briefly surpassed Chicago for the position of the state\'s largest city.[41][42] But in that same year, the Latter Day Saint movement founder, Joseph Smith, was killed in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Following a succession crisis, Brigham Young led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo quickly declined afterward.\nAfter it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port, and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois\'s largest city.[30] With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States.\nIn 1847, after lobbying by Dorothea L. Dix, Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local almshouses. Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.[43]\n\nCivil War and after\nMain article: Illinois in the American Civil War\nUnion troops embarking at Cairo on January 10, 1862\nDuring the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in soldiers who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln\'s first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.[44] The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army. For several months, both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo.\nDuring the Civil War, and more so afterwards, Chicago\'s population skyrocketed, which increased its prominence. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying four sq mi (10 km2).[45]\n\n20th century\nPolice and protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\nRising waters in Alton in 1993.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5 million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state\'s population.[46] Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4 million.\nThe Century of Progress World\'s fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County led to a boom in 1937, and by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking seventh among the 48 states.[47] Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald\'s franchise in Des Plaines, which was demolished in 1984.[48] In 1985 a replica was built on the same site to recreate how the original one looked.[48] Though this replica was demolished in 2017, due to repeated flooding of the building.[49][50]\nIllinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the nuclear age. In 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world\'s largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.[51][52]\nIn 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy. The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18.[53] The state\'s fourth constitution was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.[54]\nThe first Farm Aid concert was held in Champaign to benefit American farmers, in 1985. The worst upper Mississippi River flood of the century, the Great Flood of 1993, inundated many towns and thousands of acres of farmland.[30]\n\n21st century\nA COVID-19 safety message in the Chicago Loop\nIllinois entered the 21st century under Republican Governor George Ryan. Near the end of his term in January 2003, following a string of high-profile exonerations, Ryan commuted all death sentences in the state.[55]\nThe 2002 election brought Democrat Rod Blagojevich to the governor\'s mansion. It also brought future president Barack Obama into a committee leadership position in the Illinois Senate, where he drafted the Health Care Justice Act, a forerunner of the Affordable Care Act.[56] Obama\'s election to the presidency in Blagojevich\'s second term set off a chain of events culminating in Blagojevich\'s impeachment, trial, and subsequent criminal conviction and imprisonment, making Blagojevich the second consecutive Illinois governor to be convicted on federal corruption charges.[57]\nBlagojevich\'s replacement Pat Quinn was defeated by Republican Bruce Rauner in the 2014 election. Disagreements between the governor and legislature over budgetary policy led to the Illinois Budget Impasse, a 793-day period stretching from 2015 to 2018 in which the state had no budget and struggled to pay its bills.[58]\nOn August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers.[59][60] Some fellow Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, claiming the bill made Illinois a sanctuary state.[61]\nIn the 2018 election, Rauner was replaced by J. B. Pritzker, returning the state government to a Democratic trifecta.[62] In January 2020 the state legalized marijuana.[63]  On March 9, 2020, Pritzker issued a disaster proclamation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He ended the state of emergency in May 2023.[64]\n\nGeology\nMain article: Geology of Illinois\nDuring the early part of the Paleozoic Era, the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large coal swamps in the Carboniferous.\nIllinois was above sea level for at least part of the Mesozoic, but by its end was again submerged by the Western Interior Seaway. This receded by the Eocene Epoch.\nDuring the Pleistocene Epoch, vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the Driftless Area remaining exposed. These glaciers carved the basin of Lake Michigan and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and moraines.[65]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of Illinois\nFurther information: List of ecoregions in Illinois\nIllinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States and is one of the eight states in the Great Lakes region of North America (which also includes Ontario, Canada).\n\nBoundaries\nIllinois\'s eastern border with Indiana consists of a northâ€“south line at 87Â°â€Š31â€²â€Š30â€³ west longitude in Lake Michigan at the north, to the Wabash River in the south above Post Vincennes. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River. This marks the beginning of Illinois\'s southern border with Kentucky, which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.[66] Most of the western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state\'s northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at 42Â°â€Š30â€² north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in Lake Michigan, within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan, as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.[27]\n\nTopography\nCharles Mound, the highest natural point in Illinois at 1,235 feet (376 m) above sea level, is located in the Driftless Area in the northwestern part of the state.\nThough Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Southern Illinois includes the hilly areas around the Shawnee National Forest.\nCharles Mound, located in the Driftless region, has the state\'s highest natural elevation above sea level at 1,235 ft (376 m). Other highlands include the Shawnee Hills in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the Illinois River bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom.\n\nDivisions\nAt 279 feet (85 m) above sea level,[67] the lowest elevation point in the state is located near Cairo and the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\nIllinois has three major geographical divisions. Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicago metropolitan area, or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has a population of over 9.8 million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of Rockford, Illinois\'s third-largest city and center of the state\'s fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some 75 mi (121 km) northwest of Chicago. The Quad Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called Central Illinois. Historically prairie, it is now mainly agricultural and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and mediumâ€“small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include Peoria; Springfield, the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington-Normal; and Champaign-Urbana.[27]\nThe third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.[27][68] This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage, unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, such as East St. Louis, are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the Metro-East. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.[27] A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville, Indiana, Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.\nIn addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago metropolitan area is often called \"downstate\" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in Northern Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockfordâ€”which is actually north of Chicagoâ€”are sometimes incorrectly considered to be \'downstate\'.\n\nClimate\nMain article: Climate of Illinois\nSee also: St. Louis tornado history\nKÃ¶ppen climate types of Illinois\nIllinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 48 in (1,219 mm) at the southern tip to around 35 in (889 mm) in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 in (965 mm) in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 in (356 mm).[69] The all-time high temperature was 117 Â°F (47 Â°C), recorded on July 14, 1954, at East St. Louis, and the all-time low temperature was âˆ’38 Â°F (âˆ’39 Â°C), recorded on January 31, 2019, during the January 2019 North American cold wave at a weather station near Mount Carroll,[70][71] and confirmed on March 5, 2019.[72] This followed the previous record of âˆ’36 Â°F (âˆ’38 Â°C) recorded on January 5, 1999, near Congerville.[72] Prior to the Mount Carroll record, a temperature of âˆ’37 Â°F (âˆ’38 Â°C) was recorded on January 15, 2009, at Rochelle, but at a weather station not subjected to the same quality control as official records.[73][74]\nIllinois averages approximately 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes, with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per 10,000 sq mi (30,000 km2) annually.[75] While tornadoes are no more powerful in Illinois than other states, some of Tornado Alley\'s deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred in the state. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims died in Illinois.[76]\n\n\nMonthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Illinois Cities (Â°F)\n\n\nCity\n\nJanuary\n\nFebruary\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nDecember\n\n\nCairo[77]\n\n43/25\n\n48/29\n\n59/37\n\n70/46\n\n78/57\n\n86/67\n\n90/71\n\n88/69\n\n81/61\n\n71/49\n\n57/39\n\n46/30\n\n\nChicago[78]\n\n31/16\n\n36/21\n\n47/31\n\n59/42\n\n70/52\n\n81/61\n\n85/65\n\n83/65\n\n75/57\n\n64/45\n\n48/34\n\n36/22\n\n\nEdwardsville[79]\n\n36/19\n\n42/24\n\n52/34\n\n64/45\n\n75/55\n\n84/64\n\n89/69\n\n86/66\n\n79/58\n\n68/46\n\n53/35\n\n41/25\n\n\nMoline[80]\n\n30/12\n\n36/18\n\n48/29\n\n62/39\n\n73/50\n\n83/60\n\n86/64\n\n84/62\n\n76/53\n\n64/42\n\n48/30\n\n34/18\n\n\nPeoria[81]\n\n31/14\n\n37/20\n\n49/30\n\n62/40\n\n73/51\n\n82/60\n\n86/65\n\n84/63\n\n77/54\n\n64/42\n\n49/31\n\n36/20\n\n\nRockford[82]\n\n27/11\n\n33/16\n\n46/27\n\n59/37\n\n71/48\n\n80/58\n\n83/63\n\n81/61\n\n74/52\n\n62/40\n\n46/29\n\n32/17\n\n\nSpringfield[83]\n\n33/17\n\n39/22\n\n51/32\n\n63/42\n\n74/53\n\n83/62\n\n86/66\n\n84/64\n\n78/55\n\n67/44\n\n51/34\n\n38/23\n\nUrban areas\nSee also: Illinois statistical areas and List of municipalities in Illinois\nChicago is the largest city in the state and the third-most populous city in the United States, with a population of 2,746,388 in 2020. Furthermore, over 7 million residents of the Chicago metropolitan area reside in Illinois. The U.S. Census Bureau currently lists seven other cities with populations of over 100,000 within the state. This includes the Chicago satellite towns of Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, and Elgin, as well as the cities of Rockford, the most populous city in the state outside of the Chicago area; Springfield, the state\'s capital; and Peoria.\nThe most populated city in the state south of Springfield is Belleville, with 42,000 residents. It is located in the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis, the second-most populous urban area in Illinois with over 700,000 residents. Other major urban areas include the Peoria metropolitan area, Rockford metropolitan area, Champaignâ€“Urbana metropolitan area (home to the University of Illinois), Springfield metropolitan area, the Illinois portion of the Quad Cities area, and the Bloomingtonâ€“Normal metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Largest cities or towns in Illinois2020 U.S. census[84]\n\n\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nCounty\n\nPop.\n\n\n\nChicagoAurora\n\n1\nChicago\nCook\n2,746,388\n11\nCicero\nCook\n85,268\n\nJolietNaperville\n\n\n2\nAurora\nKane\n180,542\n12\nSchaumburg\nCook\n78,723\n\n\n3\nJoliet\nWill\n150,362\n13\nBloomington\nMcLean\n78,680\n\n\n4\nNaperville\nDuPage\n149,540\n14\nEvanston\nCook\n78,110\n\n\n5\nRockford\nWinnebago\n148,655\n15\nArlington Heights\nCook\n77,676\n\n\n6\nElgin\nKane, Cook\n114,797\n16\nBolingbrook\nWill, DuPage\n73,922\n\n\n7\nSpringfield\nSangamon\n114,394\n17\nDecatur\nMacon\n70,522\n\n\n8\nPeoria\nPeoria\n113,150\n18\nPalatine\nCook\n67,908\n\n\n9\nWaukegan\nLake\n89,321\n19\nSkokie\nCook\n67,824\n\n\n10\nChampaign\nChampaign\n88,302\n20\nDes Plaines\nCook\n60,675\n\n\nDemographics\n\nIllinois â€“ Racial and Ethnic Composition (NH = Non-Hispanic)Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Illinois\' population slightly declined in 2020 from the 2010 United States census by just over 18,000 residents and the overall population was quite higher than recent census estimates.[89]\nIllinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region. Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed. Although the Chicago metropolitan area comprises only 9% of the land area of the state, it contains 65% of the state\'s residents. The losses of population anticipated from the 2020 census results do not arise from the Chicago metro area; rather the declines are from the Downstate counties.[90]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 9,212 homeless people in Illinois.[91][92]\n\n\nEthnic composition as of the 2020 census\nhide\n\nRace and ethnicity[93]\n\nAlone\n\nTotal\n\n\nWhite (non-Hispanic)\n\n58.3%\n\n58.3 \n\n61.3%\n\n61.3 \n\n\nHispanic or Latino[c]\n\nâ€”\n\n\n\n18.2%\n\n18.2 \n\n\nAfrican American (non-Hispanic)\n\n13.9%\n\n13.9 \n\n15.0%\n\n15 \n\n\nAsian\n\n5.8%\n\n5.8 \n\n6.7%\n\n6.7 \n\n\nNative American\n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n1.1%\n\n1.1 \n\n\nPacific Islander\n\n0.02%\n\n0.02 \n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n\nOther\n\n0.4%\n\n0.4 \n\n1.1%\n\n1.1 \n\n\nIllinois Racial Breakdown of Population\nhide\n\nRacial composition\n1990[94]\n2000[95]\n2010[96]\n\n\nWhite\n78.3%\n73.5%\n71.5%\n\n\nBlack\n14.8%\n15.1%\n14.5%\n\n\nAsian\n2.5%\n3.4%\n4.6%\n\n\nNative\n0.2%\n0.2%\n0.3%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n\n\nOther race\n4.2%\n5.8%\n6.7%\n\n\nTwo or more races\nâ€”\n1.9%\n2.3%\n\n2022 American Community Survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Makeup of Illinois (2022)[97]\n\n  White alone (61.07%)  Black alone (13.43%)  Native American alone (0.69%)  Asian Alone (6.00%)  Pacific Islander Alone (0.06%)  Some other race alone (7.89%)  Two or more races (10.87%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial/Ethnic Makeup of Illinois excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2022)[97]NH=Non-Hispanic\n\n  White NH (58.47%)  Black NH (13.20%)  Native American NH (0.08%)  Asian NH (5.94%)  Pacific Islander NH (0.03%)  Other NH (0.36%)  Two or more races NH (3.64%)  Hispanic Any Race (18.28%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Makeup of Hispanics in Illinois (2022)[97]\n\n  White alone (14.23%)  Black alone (1.27%)  Native American alone (3.33%)  Asian Alone (0.33%)  Pacific Islander Alone (0.15%)  Other race alone (41.17%)  Two or more races (39.52%)\n\n\n\nAccording to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, Illinois\' population was 61.1% White, 13.4% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American or Alaskan Native, 6.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 7.9% Some Other Race, and 10.9% from two or more races.[97] The white population continues to remain the largest racial category in Illinois.

If treated as a separate category, Hispanics are the largest minority group in Illinois.[97]\nThe state\'s most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 83.5% in 1970[98] to 58.5% in 2022.[97]\nAs of 2011[update], 49.4% of Illinois\'s population younger than age 1 were minorities (Note: Children born to white Hispanics or to a sole full or partial minority parent are counted as minorities).[99]\nAt the 2007 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 1,768,518 foreign-born inhabitants of the state or 13.8% of the population, with 48.4% from Latin America, 24.6% from Asia, 22.8% from Europe, 2.9% from Africa, 1.2% from Canada, and 0.2% from Oceania. Of the foreign-born population, 43.7% were naturalized U.S. citizens, and 56.3% were not U.S. citizens.[100] In 2007, 6.9% of Illinois\'s population was reported as being under age 5, 24.9% under age 18 and 12.1% were age 65 and over. Females made up approximately 50.7% of the population.[101] The top countries of origin for immigrants in Illinois were Mexico, India, Poland, the Philippines and China in 2018.[102]\nAccording to the 2007 estimates, 21.1% of the population had German ancestry, 13.3% had Irish ancestry, 8% had British ancestry, 7.9% had Polish ancestry, 6.4% had Italian ancestry, 4.6% listed themselves as American, 2.4% had Swedish ancestry, 2.2% had French ancestry, other than Basque, 1.6% had Dutch ancestry, and 1.4% had Norwegian ancestry.[100] Illinois also has large numbers of African Americans and Latinos (mostly Mexicans and Puerto Ricans).\nChicago, along the shores of Lake Michigan, is the nation\'s third largest city. In 2000, 23.3% of Illinois\'s population lived in the city of Chicago, 43.3% in Cook County, and 65.6% in the counties of the Chicago metropolitan area: Will, DuPage, Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties, as well as Cook County. The remaining population lives in the smaller cities and rural areas that dot the state\'s plains.

Nearly 80% of people in Illinois speak English natively, and most of the rest speak it fluently as a second language.[115] A number of dialects of American English are spoken, ranging from Inland Northern American English and African-American English around Chicago, to Midland American English in Central Illinois, to Southern American English in the far south.\nOver 20% of Illinoians speak a language other than English at home, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread, at more than 12% of the total population.[116] A sizeable number of Polish speakers is present in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Illinois Country French has mostly gone extinct in Illinois, although it is still celebrated in the French Colonial Historic District.\n\nReligion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligion in Illinois (2014)[117][118]\n\n  Protestantism (43%)  Roman Catholicism (28%)  No religion (22%)  Judaism (2%)  Islam (1%)  Buddhism (1%)  Hinduism (1%)  Other religion (1%)  No response given/Unknown (1%)\n\n\nChristianity\nRoman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago and account for nearly 30% of the state\'s population.[119] However, taken together as a group, the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state\'s population than do Catholics. In 2010, Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 314,461 members and the Southern Baptist Convention with 283,519. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of Missouri Synod Lutherans in the United States.\nIllinois played an important role in the early Latter Day Saint movement, with Nauvoo becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the succession crisis, which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into several Latter Day Saint sects. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.[120]\n\nOther Abrahamic religious communities\nThe BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois\nA significant number of adherents of other Abrahamic faiths can be found in Illinois. Largely concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area, followers of the Muslim, BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­, and Jewish religions all call the state home.[121] Muslims constituted the largest non-Christian group, with 359,264 adherents.[122] Illinois has the largest concentration of Muslims by state in the country, with 2,800 Muslims per 100,000 citizens.[123]\nThe largest and oldest surviving BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ House of Worship in the world is located on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wilmette, Illinois, one of eight continental BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ House of Worship.[124] It serves as a space for people of all backgrounds and religions to gather, meditate, reflect, and pray, expressing the BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ principle of the oneness of religions.[125] The Chicago area has a very large Jewish community, particularly in the suburbs of Skokie, Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and surrounding suburbs. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was the Windy City\'s first Jewish mayor.\n\nOther religions\nChicago is also home to a very large population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists.[121]\n\nEconomy\nMain article: Economy of Illinois\nSee also: List of Illinois locations by per capita income\nIllinois counties by GDP (2021)\nAs of 2022, the gross state product for Illinois reached US$1.0 trillion.[126]\nAs of February 2019, the unemployment rate in Illinois reached 4.2%.[127]\nIllinois\'s minimum wage will rise to $15 per hour by 2025, making it one of the highest in the nation.[128]\n\nAgriculture\nMain article: Agriculture in Illinois\nA John Deere combine harvester on an Illinois farm; the company is headquartered in Moline, Illinois.\nIllinois\'s major agricultural outputs are corn, soybeans, hogs, cattle, dairy products, and wheat. In most years, Illinois is either the first or second state for the highest production of soybeans, with a harvest of 427.7 million bushels (11.64 million metric tons) in 2008, after Iowa\'s production of 444.82 million bushels (12.11 million metric tons).[129] Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5 billion bushels produced annually.[130] With a production capacity of 1.5 billion gallons per year, Illinois is a top producer of ethanol, ranking third in the United States in 2011.[131] Illinois is a leader in food manufacturing and meat processing.[132] Although Chicago may no longer be \"Hog Butcher for the World\", the Chicago area remains a global center for food manufacture and meat processing,[132] with many plants, processing houses, and distribution facilities concentrated in the area of the former Union Stock Yards.[133] Illinois also produces wine, and the state is home to two American viticultural areas. In the area of The Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Byway, peaches and apples are grown. The German immigrants from agricultural backgrounds who settled in Illinois in the mid- to late 19th century are in part responsible for the profusion of fruit orchards in that area of Illinois.[134] Illinois\'s universities are actively researching alternative agricultural products as alternative crops.\n\nManufacturing\nIllinois is one of the nation\'s manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107 billion in 2006. As of 2011[update], Illinois is ranked as the 4th-most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio.[135] About three-quarters of the state\'s manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois\'s approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3 billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4 billion), food manufacturing ($12.9 billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5 billion), transportation equipment ($7.4 billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0 billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1 billion).[136]\n\nServices\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, one of twelve Federal Reserve Banks, at the heart of Chicago\'s financial center.\nBy the early 2000s, Illinois\'s economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois\'s earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.\n\nInvestments\nVenture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62 billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1 billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461 billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7 billion.[citation needed]\n\nEnergy\nSee also: List of power stations in Illinois and Solar power in Illinois\nIllinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.[137]\n\nCoal\nLocation of the Illinois Basin\nThe coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal & Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula.[138] However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain, unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.[27][30][68] Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4 million tons of coal, but only 17 million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported three million tons of coal, and was projected to export nine million in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.[139] As of 2010[update], Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the nation.[131] Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21 million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.[137]\nMattoon was chosen as the site for the Department of Energy\'s FutureGen project, a 275-megawatt experimental zero emission coal-burning power plant that the DOE just gave a second round of funding. In 2010, after a number of setbacks, the city of Mattoon backed out of the project.[140]\n\nPetroleum\nIllinois is a leading refiner of petroleum in the American Midwest, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly 900,000 bbl/d (140,000 m3/d). However, Illinois has very limited crude oil proved reserves that account for less than 1% of the U.S. total reserves. Residential heating is 81% natural gas compared to less than 1% heating oil. Illinois is ranked 14th in oil production among states, with a daily output of approximately 28,000 bbl (4,500 m3) in 2005.[141][142]\n\nNuclear power\nMain article: Nuclear power in the United States\nByron Nuclear Generating Station in Ogle County\nNuclear power arguably began in Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world\'s first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in the world\'s first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle, and Quad Cities.[143] With the exception of the single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the nation\'s total.[131] In 2007, 48% of Illinois\'s electricity was generated using nuclear power.[144] The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.\n\nWind power\nMain article: Wind power in Illinois\nAverage annual wind power distribution for Illinois, 50 m (160 ft) height above ground (2009)\nIllinois has seen growing interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation.[145] Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as \"marginal or fair\" for wind energy production by the U.S. Department of Energy, with some western sections rated \"good\" and parts of the south rated \"poor\".[146] These ratings are for wind turbines with 50 m (160 ft) hub heights; newer wind turbines are taller, enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground. As a result, more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites. As of September 2009, Illinois had 1116.06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741.9 MW under construction.[147] Illinois ranked ninth among U.S. states in installed wind power capacity, and sixteenth by potential capacity.[147] Large wind farms in Illinois include Twin Groves, Rail Splitter, EcoGrove, and Mendota Hills.[147]\nAs of 2007, wind energy represented only 1.7% of Illinois\'s energy production, and it was estimated that wind power could provide 5â€“10% of the state\'s energy needs.[148][149] Also, the Illinois General Assembly mandated in 2007 that by 2025, 25% of all electricity generated in Illinois is to come from renewable resources.[150]\n\nBiofuels\nIllinois is ranked second in corn production among U.S. states, and Illinois corn is used to produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States.[130] The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois, is the world\'s leading producer of ethanol from corn.\nThe National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the world\'s only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol is located on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.[151][152]\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is one of the partners in the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a $500 million biofuels research project funded by petroleum giant BP.[153][154]\n\nTaxes\nTax is collected by the Illinois Department of Revenue. State income tax is calculated by multiplying net income by a flat rate. In 1990, that rate was set at 3%, but in 2010, the General Assembly voted for a temporary increase in the rate to 5%; the new rate went into effect on January 1, 2011; the personal income rate partially sunset on January 1, 2015, to 3.75%, while the corporate income tax fell to 5.25%.[155][156] Illinois failed to pass a budget from 2015 to 2017, after the 736-day budget impasse, a budget was passed in Illinois after lawmakers overturned Governor Bruce Rauner\'s veto; this budget raised the personal income rate to 4.95% and the corporate rate to 7%.[157] There are two rates for state sales tax: 6.25% for general merchandise and 1% for qualifying food, drugs, and medical appliances.[158] The property tax is a major source of tax revenue for local government taxing districts. The property tax is a localâ€”not stateâ€”tax, imposed by local government taxing districts, which include counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, and special taxation districts. The property tax in Illinois is imposed only on real property.[27][30][68]\nOn May 1, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted to approve a constitutional amendment that would have stricken language from the Illinois Constitution requiring a flat state income tax, in a 73â€“44 vote. If approved, the amendment would have allowed the state legislature to impose a graduated income tax based on annual income. The governor, J. B. Pritzker, approved the bill on May 27, 2019. It was scheduled for a 2020 general election ballot vote[159][160] and required 60 percent voter approval to effectively amend the state constitution.[161] The amendment was not approved by Illinoisans, with 55.1% of voters voting \"No\" on approval and 44.9% voting \"Yes\".[162]\nAs of 2017 Chicago had the highest state and local sales tax rate for a U.S. city with a populations above 200,000, at 10.250%.[163] The state of Illinois has the second highest rate of real estate tax: 2.31%, which is second only to New Jersey at 2.44%.[164]\nToll roads are a de facto user tax on the citizens and visitors to the state of Illinois. Illinois ranks seventh out of the 11 states with the most miles of toll roads, at 282.1 miles. Chicago ranks fourth in most expensive toll roads in America by the mile, with the Chicago Skyway charging 51.2 cents per mile.[165] Illinois also has the 11th highest gasoline tax by state, at 37.5 cents per gallon.[166]\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums in Illinois.\nIllinois has numerous museums; the greatest concentration of these are in Chicago. Several museums in Chicago are ranked as some of the best in the world. These include the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Adler Planetarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry.\nThe modern Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield is the largest and most attended presidential library in the country. The Illinois State Museum boasts a collection of 13.5 million objects that tell the story of Illinois life, land, people, and art. The ISM is among only 5% of the nation\'s museums that are accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Other historical museums in the state include the Polish Museum of America in Chicago; Magnolia Manor in Cairo; Easley Pioneer Museum in Ipava; the Elihu Benjamin Washburne; Ulysses S. Grant Homes, both in Galena; and the Chanute Air Museum, located on the former Chanute Air Force Base in Rantoul.\nThe Chicago metropolitan area also hosts two zoos: The Brookfield Zoo, located about ten miles west of the city center in suburban Brookfield, contains more than 2,300 animals and covers 216 acres (87 ha). The Lincoln Park Zoo is located in Lincoln Park on Chicago\'s North Side, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) north of the Loop. The zoo accounts for more than 35 acres (14 ha) of the park.\n\n\nIllinois Museums\n\n\nVandalia State House State Historic Site in Vandalia\n\n\n\nThe Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago\n\n\n\nMagnolia Manor is a Victorian period historic house museum in Cairo.\n\n\n\nLincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield\n\n\n\nThe Polish Museum of America in Chicago\n\n\n\nA Railway Post Office preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union\n\n\nMusic\nMain article: Music of Illinois\nIllinois is a leader in music education, having hosted the Midwest Clinic International Band and Orchestra Conference since 1946, as well being home to the Illinois Music Educators Association (ILMEA, formerly IMEA), one of the largest professional music educator\'s organizations in the country. Each summer since 2004, Southern Illinois University Carbondale has played host to the Southern Illinois Music Festival, which presents dozens of performances throughout the region. Past featured artists include the Eroica Trio and violinist David Kim.\nChicago, in the northeast corner of the state, is a major center for music[167] in the midwestern United States where distinctive forms of blues (greatly responsible for the future creation of rock and roll), and house music, a genre of electronic dance music, were developed.\nThe Great Migration of poor black workers from the South into the industrial cities brought traditional jazz and blues music to the city, resulting in Chicago blues and \"Chicago-style\" Dixieland jazz. Notable blues artists included Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Howlin\' Wolf and both Sonny Boy Williamsons; jazz greats included Nat King Cole, Gene Ammons, Benny Goodman, and Bud Freeman. Chicago is also well known for its soul music.\nIn the early 1930s, Gospel music began to gain popularity in Chicago due to Thomas A. Dorsey\'s contributions at Pilgrim Baptist Church.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, heavy rock, punk, and hip hop also became popular in Chicago. Orchestras in Chicago include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Chicago Sinfonietta.[168]\n\nMovies\nJohn Hughes, who moved from Grosse Pointe to Northbrook, based many films of his in Chicago, and its suburbs. Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off, Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, and all his films take place in the fictional Shermer, Illinois (the original name of Northbrook was Shermerville, and Hughes\'s High School, Glenbrook North High School, is on Shermer Road). Most locations in his films include Glenbrook North, the former Maine North High School, the Ben Rose House in Highland Park, and the famous Home Alone house in Winnetka, Illinois.\n\nSports\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of professional sports teams in Illinois.\nSoldier Field is home to the National Football League\'s Chicago Bears\nWrigley Field is home to Major League Baseball\'s Chicago Cubs\nMajor league sports\nAs one of the United States\' major metropolises, all major sports leagues have teams headquartered in Chicago.\n\nTwo Major League Baseball teams are located in the state.

The dragstrip at Gateway International Raceway and the Route 66 Raceway, which sits on the same property as the Chicagoland Speedway, both host NHRA drag races.\n\nGolf\nIllinois features several golf courses, such as Olympia Fields, Medinah, Midlothian, Cog Hill, and Conway Farms, which have often hosted the BMW Championship, Western Open, and Women\'s Western Open.\nAlso, the state has hosted 13 editions of the U.S. Open (latest at Olympia Fields in 2003), six editions of the PGA Championship (latest at Medinah in 2006), three editions of the U.S. Women\'s Open (latest at The Merit Club), the 2009 Solheim Cup (at Rich Harvest Farms), and the 2012 Ryder Cup (at Medinah).\nThe John Deere Classic is a regular PGA Tour event played in the Quad Cities since 1971, whereas the Encompass Championship is a Champions Tour event since 2013. Previously, the LPGA State Farm Classic was an LPGA Tour event from 1976 to 2011.\n\nParks and recreation\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of protected areas of Illinois.\nSunset on the Garden of the Gods Wilderness, part of the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois.\nThe Illinois state parks system began in 1908 with what is now Fort Massac State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing more than 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas.\nAreas under the protection of the National Park Service include: the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor near Lockport,[171] the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, the American Discovery Trail,[172] the Pullman National Monument, and New Philadelphia Town Site. The federal government also manages the Shawnee National Forest and the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie.\n\nLaw and politics\nMain articles: Law of Illinois and Politics of Illinois\nIn a 2020 study, Illinois was ranked as the 4th easiest state for citizens to vote in.[173]\n\nState government\nMain article: Government of Illinois\nThe Illinois State Capitol in Springfield\nThe government of Illinois, under the Constitution of Illinois, has three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.\nThe executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments.[174] The six elected officers are:[174] Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer. The government of Illinois has numerous departments, agencies, boards and commissions, but the so-called code departments provide most of the state\'s services.[174][175]\n\nIllinois House of Representatives\nThe Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59-member Illinois Senate. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature.[176][177]\nThe Judiciary of Illinois is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the Supreme Court, Appellate Court, and Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system.\nThe administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts.[178] The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties.[179] Eighty-five of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts.[179][180] Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns.[179] Some localities possess home rule, which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.[181]\n\nParty balance\nGovernor J. B. Pritzker (D)\nIllinois is a Democratic stronghold.[182] Historically, Illinois was a political swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground, and Illinois has come to be seen as a solid \"blue\" state in presidential campaigns.[183][184] Votes from Chicago and most of Cook County have long been strongly Democratic. However, the \"collar counties\" (the suburban counties surrounding Cook County) can be seen as moderate voting districts.[185][186] College towns like Carbondale, Champaign, and Normal also lean Democratic.\nRepublicans continue to prevail in the rural areas of northern and central Illinois, as well as southern Illinois outside of East St. Louis. From 1920 until 1972, Illinois was carried by the victor of each of these 14 presidential elections.[187] In fact, the state was long seen as a national bellwether,[188] supporting the winner in every election in the 20th century, except for 1916 and 1976. By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party, and has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. Local politician and Chicago resident Barack Obama easily won the state\'s 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent governor Pat Quinn was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate Mitt Romney\'s 41%. In 2014, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Governor Quinn 50% to 46% to become Illinois\'s first Republican governor in 12 years after being sworn in on January 12, 2015, while Democratic senator Dick Durbin was re-elected with 53% of the vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Illinois with 55% of the vote, and Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent Mark Kirk 54% to 40%. George W. Bush and Donald Trump are the only Republican presidential candidates to win without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. In 2018, Democrat J. B. Pritzker defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\nHistory of corruption\nMain article: Political corruption in Illinois\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. On December 7, 2011, former governor Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Blagojevich had earlier been impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State Paul Powell was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.[30][68][189]\n\nU.S. presidential elections\nMain article: United States presidential elections in Illinois\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and most recently Barack Obama. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives before his election to the presidency in 1860. Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and made Illinois his home after graduating from law school, and later represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\nRonald Reagan was born in Illinois, in the city of Tampico, raised in Dixon, Illinois, and educated at Eureka College, outside Peoria. Reagan later moved to California during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became California\'s Governor before being elected president.\nHillary Clinton was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in New York State.\n\nAfrican-American U.S. senators\nTwelve African-Americans have served as members of the United States Senate. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: Carol Moseley-Braun,[190] Barack Obama,[191] and Roland Burris, who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\nPolitical families\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the Democratic Party, gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\nStevenson\nThe Stevenson family, initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n\nAdlai Stevenson I (1835â€“1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a Congressman\nLewis Stevenson (1868â€“1929), son of Adlai, served as Illinois Secretary of State.\nAdlai Stevenson II (1900â€“1965), son of Lewis, served as Governor of Illinois and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party\'s presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight Eisenhower.\nAdlai Stevenson III (1930â€“2021), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a United States Senator.\nDaley\nThe Daley family\'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n\nRichard J. Daley (1902â€“1976) served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 to his death.\nRichard M. Daley (1942â€“), son of Richard J, was Chicago\'s longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\nWilliam M. Daley (1948â€“), another son of Richard J, is a former White House Chief of Staff and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\nPritzker\nThe Pritzker family is based in Chicago and have played important roles in both the private and the public sectors.\n\nJay Pritzker (1922â€“1999), co-founder of Hyatt Hotel based in Chicago.\nPenny Pritzker (born 1959), 38th United States Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama.\nJ. B. Pritzker (born 1965), current and 43rd governor of Illinois and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\nEducation\nThe Illini Union at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\nCampus of the University of Chicago\nIllinois State Board of education\nMain article: Illinois State Board of Education\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers public education in the state. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the Illinois School Report Card. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\nSee also: List of school districts in Illinois and List of high schools in Illinois\nEducation is compulsory for ages 7â€“17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in two school districtsâ€”one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\nColleges and universities\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of colleges and universities in Illinois.\nUsing the criterion established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state.\nAs of 19 August 2010[update], six of these rank in the \"first tier\" among the top 500 National Universities in the nation, as determined by the U.S. News & World Report rankings: the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Loyola University Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University, University of Illinois Chicago, Illinois State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Northern Illinois University.[192] The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world\'s top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its Booth School of Business, along with Northwestern\'s Kellogg School of Management consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and United States.\nIllinois also has more than twenty additional accredited four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small liberal arts colleges across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public community colleges in the Illinois Community College System.\n\nSchool financing\nSchools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically \"inequitable\", a system where one of \"the wealthiest of states\" is \"the stingiest in its support for education\". There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other \"soft\" segregation methods) resulted in the formula\'s abolition in the late 1980s.[193]\n\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nSee also: List of Illinois Routes\nBecause of its central location and its proximity to the Rust Belt and Grain Belt, Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.\n\nAirports\nSee also: List of airports in Illinois\nConcourse B inside O\'Hare International Airport, one of the world\'s busiest airports\nFrom 1962 until 1998, Chicago\'s O\'Hare International Airport (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta\'s Hartsfield in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O\'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3 million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4 million international passengers in 2008,[194] O\'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for both United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Midway Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O\'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation\'s busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for Southwest Airlines and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3 million domestic and international passengers in 2008.[195]\n\nRail\nSee also: List of Illinois railroads\nIllinois major rail network\nIllinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak\'s Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale Illini and Saluki, the Chicago to Quincy Carl Sandburg and Illinois Zephyr, and the Chicago to St. Louis Lincoln Service. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicagoâ€“St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to 110 mph (180 km/h), which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive heavy rail service is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority\'s \'L\' system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nWaterways\nSee also: Category:Illinois waterways\nIn addition to the state\'s rail lines, the Mississippi River and Illinois River provide major transportation routes for the state\'s agricultural interests. Lake Michigan gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.\n\nInterstate highway system\nMain article: List of Interstate Highways in Illinois\nThe Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the state.[196]\nIllinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13. Illinois also ranks third among the fifty states with the most interstate mileage, coming in after California and Texas, which are much bigger states in area.[197]\nMajor U.S. Interstate highways crossing the state include: Interstate 24 (I-24), I-39, I-41, I-55, I-57, I-64, I-70, I-72, I-74, I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94.\n\nU.S. highway system\nMain article: List of U.S. Highways in Illinois\nAn Illinois welcome sign along U.S. Route 67 in Rock Island\nThe Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining the U.S Highways in Illinois. The system in Illinois consists of 21 primary highways.\nAmong the U.S. highways that pass through the state, the primary ones are: US 6, US 12, US 14, US 20, US 24, US 30, US 34, US 36, US 40, US 41, US 45, US 50, US 51, US 52, US 54, US 60, US 62, and US 67.\n\nIntercity buses\nSee also: List of intercity bus stops in Illinois\nDue to its central location, Illinois sees numerous intercity bus services primarily connecting east and west. The Chicago Bus Station is the busiest intercity bus station in the state. The following carriers provide scheduled service: Amtrak Thruway, Barons Bus Lines, Burlington Trailways, Flixbus, Greyhound Lines, Indian Trails, Miller Transportation (Hoosier Ride), Peoria Charter Coach Company, Van Galder Bus Company, and Wisconsin Coach Lines.\n\nLocal buses\n\n\nhideLocal transit map\n\n\nBeloit TransitC-CARTSMTDChicago Transit AuthorityColes County ZiplineConnect TransitDMTDPTSDeKalb Public TransitGalesburg TransitGo West TransitCityLinkJCMTDSaluki ExpressRMTDMadison County TransitMetroLINKPaceQuincy Transit LinesRiver Valley MetroRMTDSCCTDSMTDSHOW BusSouth Central TransitMRTDRMTDSHOW Busclass=notpageimage| Local Transit Systems (Only systems with fixed-route services are shown)\n\nGallery\n\n\n\nStandard license plate introduced in 2017\n\n\n\nIllinois license plate design used throughout the 1980s and 1990s, displaying the Land of Lincoln slogan that has been featured on the state\'s plates since 1954\n\n\nSee also\n\nIllinois portalUnited States portal\nIndex of Illinois-related articles\nList of people from Illinois\nOutline of Illinois\nUSS Illinois, 4 ships\nNotes\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n^ Illinois borders the state of Wisconsin to its north, Iowa to its northwest, Missouri to its southwest, Kentucky to its south, Indiana to its east, and has a water border with Michigan to the northeast in Lake Michigan.\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Charles\".

Largely unaltered with the exception of additions (the letters âŸ¨JâŸ©, âŸ¨UâŸ©, and âŸ¨WâŸ©) and extensions (such as diacritics), it forms the Latin script that is used to write many modern European languages, including English and many modern Asian languages, including Malay, Indonesian and Modern Standard Syloti (MSS).[1] With modifications, it is also used for other alphabets, such as the Vietnamese alphabet. Its modern repertoire is standardised as the ISO basic Latin alphabet.\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe term Latin alphabet may refer to either the alphabet used to write Latin (as described in this article) or other alphabets based on the Latin script, which is the basic set of letters common to the various alphabets descended from the classical Latin alphabet, such as the English alphabet. These Latin-script alphabets may discard letters, like the Rotokas alphabet, or add new letters, like the Danish and Norwegian alphabets. Letter shapes have evolved over the centuries, including the development in Medieval Latin of lower-case, forms which did not exist in the Classical period alphabet.\n\nEvolution[edit]\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see History of the alphabet.\nThe Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Etruscan alphabet, which evolved from the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician alphabet, which in turn derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs.[2] The Etruscans ruled early Rome; their alphabet evolved in Rome over successive centuries to produce the Latin alphabet.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Latin alphabet was used (sometimes with modifications) for writing Romance languages, which are direct descendants of Latin, as well as Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and some Slavic languages. With the age of colonialism and Christian evangelism, the Latin script spread beyond Europe, coming into use for writing indigenous American, Australian, Austronesian, Austroasiatic and African languages. More recently, linguists have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet (itself largely based on the Latin script) when transcribing or creating written standards for non-European languages, such as the African reference alphabet.\n\nSigns and abbreviations[edit]\nAlthough Latin did not use diacritical marks, signs of truncation of words (often placed above or at the end of the truncated word) were very common. Furthermore, abbreviations or smaller overlapping letters were often used. This was due to the fact that if the text was engraved on stone, the number of letters to be written was reduced, while if it was written on paper or parchment, it saved precious space. This habit continued even in the Middle Ages. Hundreds of symbols and abbreviations exist, varying from century to century.[3]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of the Latin script\nOrigins[edit]\nIt is generally believed that the Latin alphabet used by the Romans was derived from the Old Italic alphabet used by the Etruscans.[4]\nThat alphabet was derived from the Euboean alphabet used by the Cumae, which in turn was derived from the Phoenician alphabet.[citation needed]\n\nOld Italic alphabet[edit]\nThe Duenos inscription, dated to the 6th century BC, shows the earliest known form of the Old Latin alphabet.\n\nOld Italic alphabet\n\n\nLetters\n\nğŒ€\nğŒ\nğŒ‚\nğŒƒ\nğŒ„\nğŒ…\nğŒ†\nğŒ‡\nğŒˆ\nğŒ‰\nğŒŠ\nğŒ‹\nğŒŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ‘\nğŒ’\nğŒ“\nğŒ”\nğŒ•\nğŒ–\nğŒ—\nğŒ˜\nğŒ™\nğŒš\n\n\nTransliteration\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nV\nZ\nH\nÎ˜\nI\nK\nL\nM\nN\nÎ\nO\nP\nÅš\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nY\nX\nÎ¦\nÎ¨\nF\n\nArchaic Latin alphabet[edit]\n\nArchaic Latin alphabet\n\n\nAs Old Italic\n\nğŒ€\nğŒ\nğŒ‚\nğŒƒ\nğŒ„\nğŒ…\nğŒ†\nğŒ‡\nğŒ‰\nğŒŠ\nğŒ‹\nğŒŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ\nğŒ’\nğŒ“\nğŒ”\nğŒ•\nğŒ–\nğŒ—\n\n\nAs Latin\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nZ\nH\nI\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nV\nX\n\nOld Latin alphabet[edit]\nLatin included 21 different characters. The letter âŸ¨CâŸ© was the western form of the Greek gamma, but it was used for the sounds /É¡/ and /k/ alike, possibly under the influence of Etruscan, which might have lacked any voiced plosives. Later, probably during the 3rd century BC, the letter âŸ¨ZâŸ© â€“ not needed to write Latin properly â€“ was replaced with the new letter âŸ¨GâŸ©, a âŸ¨CâŸ© modified with a small vertical stroke, which took its place in the alphabet. From then on, âŸ¨GâŸ© represented the voiced plosive /É¡/, while âŸ¨CâŸ© was generally reserved for the voiceless plosive /k/. The letter âŸ¨KâŸ© was used only rarely, in a small number of words such as Kalendae, often interchangeably with âŸ¨CâŸ©.\n\n\nOld Latin alphabet\n\n\nLetter\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nZ\nG\nH\nI\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nV\nX\n\nClassical Latin alphabet[edit]\nAfter the Roman conquest of Greece in the 1st century BC, Latin adopted the Greek letters âŸ¨YâŸ© and âŸ¨ZâŸ© (or readopted, in the latter case) to write Greek loanwords, placing them at the end of the alphabet. An attempt by the emperor Claudius to introduce three additional letters did not last. Thus it was during the classical Latin period that the Latin alphabet contained 21 letters and 2 foreign letters:\n\n\nClassical Latin alphabet\n\n\nLetter\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nV\nX\nY\nZ\n\n\nLatin name (majus)\n\nÃ¡\nbÃ©\ncÃ©\ndÃ©\nÃ©\nef\ngÃ©\nhÃ¡\nêŸ¾\nkÃ¡\nel\nem\nen\nÃ³\npÃ©\nqvÌ\ner\nes\ntÃ©\nvÌ\nix\nêŸ¾ graeca\nzÃ©ta\n\n\nTransliteration\n\nÄ\nbÄ“\ncÄ“ \ndÄ“ \nÄ“\nef\ngÄ“ \nhÄ\nÄ«\nkÄ \nel\nem\nen\nÅ \npÄ“\nqÅ« \ner\nes \ntÄ“\nÅ«\nix \nÄ« Graeca\nzÄ“ta\n\n\nLatin pronunciation (IPA)\n\naË\nbeË\nkeË\ndeË\neË\nÉ›f\nÉ¡eË\nhaË\niË\nkaË\nÉ›l\nÉ›m\nÉ›n\noË\npeË\nkuË\nÉ›r\nÉ›s\nteË\nuË\niks\niË ËˆÉ¡raÉªka\nËˆdzeËta\n\nThe apices in this first-century inscription are very light. (There is one over the Ã³ in the first line.) The vowel I is written taller rather than taking an apex. The interpuncts are comma-shaped, an elaboration of a more typical triangular shape. From the shrine of the Augustales at Herculaneum.\nThe Latin names of some of these letters are disputed; for example, âŸ¨HâŸ© may have been called [Ëˆaha] or [Ëˆaka].[5] In general the Romans did not use the traditional (Semitic-derived) names as in Greek: the names of the plosives were formed by adding /eË/ to their sound (except for âŸ¨KâŸ© and âŸ¨QâŸ©, which needed different vowels to be distinguished from âŸ¨CâŸ©) and the names of the continuants consisted as a rule either of the bare sound, or the sound preceded by /e/.\nThe letter âŸ¨YâŸ© when introduced was probably called \"hy\" /hyË/ as in Greek, the name upsilon not being in use yet, but this was changed to i Graeca (\"Greek i\") as Latin speakers had difficulty distinguishing its foreign sound /y/ from /i/. âŸ¨ZâŸ© was given its Greek name, zeta. This scheme has continued to be used by most modern European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet. For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see Latin spelling and pronunciation; for the names of the letters in English see English alphabet.\nDiacritics were not regularly used, but they did occur sometimes, the most common being the apex used to mark long vowels, which had previously sometimes been written doubled. However, in place of taking an apex, the letter i was written taller: âŸ¨Ã¡ Ã© êŸ¾ Ã³ vÌâŸ©. For example, what is today transcribed LÅ«ciÄ« a fÄ«liÄ« was written âŸ¨lvÌciêŸ¾Â·aÂ·fêŸ¾liêŸ¾âŸ© in the inscription depicted.\nSome letters have more than one form in epigraphy.\nLatinists have treated some of them especially such as âŸ¨êŸµâŸ©, a variant of âŸ¨HâŸ© found in Roman Gaul.\nThe primary mark of punctuation was the interpunct, which was used as a word divider, though it fell out of use after 200 AD.\nOld Roman cursive script, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even emperors issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on Roman square capitals, but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century, but it probably existed earlier than that. It led to Uncial, a majuscule script commonly used from the 3rd to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes.\nTironian notes were a shorthand system consisting of thousands of signs.\nNew Roman cursive script, also known as minuscule cursive, was in use from the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; âŸ¨aâŸ©, âŸ¨bâŸ©, âŸ¨dâŸ©, and âŸ¨eâŸ© had taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters were proportionate to each other. This script evolved into a variety of regional medieval scripts (for example, the Merovingian, Visigothic and Benevantan scripts), to be later supplanted by the Carolingian minuscule.\n\nMedieval and later developments[edit]\nDe chalcographiae inventione (1541, Mainz) with the 23 letters. J, U and W are missing.\nJeton from Nuremberg, c.â€‰1553\nIt was not until the Middle Ages that the letter âŸ¨WâŸ© (originally a ligature of two âŸ¨VâŸ©s) was added to the Latin alphabet, to represent sounds from the Germanic languages which did not exist in medieval Latin, and only after the Renaissance did the convention of treating âŸ¨IâŸ© and âŸ¨UâŸ© as vowels, and âŸ¨JâŸ© and âŸ¨VâŸ© as consonants, become established. Prior to that, the former had been merely allographs of the latter.[citation needed]\nWith the fragmentation of political power, the style of writing changed and varied greatly throughout the Middle Ages, even after the invention of the printing press. Early deviations from the classical forms were the uncial script, a development of the Old Roman cursive, and various so-called minuscule scripts that developed from New Roman cursive, of which the insular script developed by Irish literati and derivations of this, such as Carolingian minuscule were the most influential, introducing the lower case forms of the letters, as well as other writing conventions that have since become standard.\nThe languages that use the Latin script generally use capital letters to begin paragraphs and sentences and proper nouns. The rules for capitalization have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. Old English, for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized, whereas Modern English writers and printers of the 17th and 18th century frequently capitalized most and sometimes all nouns,[6] e.g. in the preamble and all of the United States Constitution: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. This is still systematically done in modern German.\n\nSee also[edit]\nLatin spelling and pronunciation\nCalligraphy\nEuboean alphabet\nLatin script in Unicode\nISO basic Latin alphabet\nLatin-1\nLegacy of the Roman Empire\nPalaeography\nPhoenician alphabet\nPinyin\nRoman letters used in mathematics\nTypography\nWestern Latin character sets (computing)\nSpread of the Latin script\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Sylheti language and the Syloti-Nagri alphabet\". www.omniglot.com.

They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; it includes some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus\'s history difficult to resolve.\nEcologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls, roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple, and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.\nIn culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe generic name Quercus is Latin for \"oak\", derived from Proto-Indo-European *kwerkwu-, \"oak\", which is also the origin of the name \"fir\", another important or sacred tree in Indo-European culture. The word \"cork\", for the bark of the cork oak, similarly derives from Quercus.[1] The common name \"oak\" is from Old English ac (seen in placenames such as Acton, from ac + tun, \"oak village\"[2]), which in turn is from Proto-Germanic *aiks, \"oak\".[3]\n\nDescription[edit]\nOaks are hardwood (dicotyledonous) trees, deciduous or evergreen, with spirally arranged leaves, often with lobate margins; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both staminate (\'male\') flowers in the form of catkins, and small pistillate (\'female\') flowers,[4] meaning that the trees are monoecious. The fruit is a nut called an acorn, borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn usually contains one seed and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on the species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid,[5] which helps to guard against fungi and insects.[6] There are some 500 extant species of oaks.[7]\nTrees in the genus are often large and slow-growing; Q. alba can reach an age of 600 years, a diameter of 13 feet (4.0 m) and a height of 145 feet (44 m).[8] The Granit oak in Bulgaria, a Q. robur specimen, has an estimated age of 1637 years, making it the oldest oak in Europe.[9] The Wi\'aaSal tree, a live oak in the reservation of the Pechanga Band of Indians, California, is at least 1000 years old, and might be as much as 2000 years old, which would make it the oldest oak in the US.[10] Among the smallest oaks is Q. acuta, the Japanese evergreen oak. It forms a bush or small tree to a height of some 30 feet (9.1 m).[11]\n\n\n\n\nQuercus robur habit\n\n\n\nIllustration of Quercus lusitanica showing staminate (left) and pistillate flowers, which mature into acorns (right)\n\n\n\nCatkins of Quercus alba containing the staminate or \'male\' flowers\n\n\n\nNew leaves and reddish pistillate or \'female\' flowers of Quercus robur\n\n\nDistribution[edit]\nGlobal distribution of Quercus. The New and Old World parts are mostly separate clades.[a] Red: North American.[b] Pink: Central American.[c] Yellow: European.[d] Green: West/Central Asian.[e] Turquoise: Southeast Asian.[f] Blue: East Asian.[g][12] See Phylogeny chapter/tree for sections.\nThe genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico, of which 109 are endemic, and about 90 in the United States. The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.[13]\nIn the Americas, Quercus is widespread from Vancouver and Nova Scotia in the south of Canada, south to Mexico and across the whole of the eastern United States. It is present in a small area of the west of Cuba; in Mesoamerica it occurs mainly above 1000 metres.[14] The genus crossed the isthmus of Panama when the northern and southern continents came together[15] and is present as one species, Q. humboldtii, above 1000 metres in Colombia.[14] The oaks of North America are of many sections (Protobalanus, Lobatae, Ponticae, Quercus, and Virentes) along with related genera such as Notholithocarpus.[12]\nIn the Old World, oaks of section Quercus extend across the whole of Europe including European Russia apart from the far north, and north Africa (north of the Sahara) from Morocco to Libya. In Mediterranean Europe, they are joined by oaks of the sections Cerris and Ilex, which extend across Turkey, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, while section Ponticae is endemic to the western Caucasus in Turkey and Georgia. Oaks of section Cyclobalanopsis extend in a narrow belt along the Himalayas to cover mainland and island Southeast Asia as far as Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Palawan.[7][16] Finally, oaks of multiple sections (Cyclobalanopsis, Ilex, Cerris, Quercus and related genera like Lithocarpus and Castanopsis) extend across east Asia including China, Korea, and Japan.[12]\n\nEvolution[edit]\nFossil history[edit]\nPotential records of Quercus have been reported from Late Cretaceous deposits in North America and East Asia. These are not considered definitive, as macrofossils older than the Paleogene, and possibly from before the Eocene are mostly poorly preserved without critical features for certain identification. Amongst the oldest unequivocal records of Quercus are pollen from Austria, dating to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, around 55 million years ago. The oldest records of Quercus in North America are from Oregon, dating to the Middle Eocene, around 44 million years ago, with the oldest records in Asia from the Middle Eocene of Japan; both forms have affinities to the Cyclobalanopsis group.[17]\n\n\n\n\nQuercus × hispanica leaf.

However, the high signal of introgressive hybridization (the transfer of genetic material by repeated backcrossing with hybrid offspring) in the genus has made it difficult to resolve an unambiguous, unitary history of oaks.

Quercus\nSect. Lobatae (synonym Erythrobalanus), the red oaks of North America, Central America and northern South America. Styles are long; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The actual nut is encased in a thin, clinging, papery skin. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe.[29]\nSect. Protobalanus, the canyon live oak and its relatives, in the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico. Styles are short; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.[29]\nSect. Ponticae, a disjunct including just two species. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves have large stipules, high secondary veins, and are highly toothed.[29]\nSect. Virentes, the southern live oaks of the Americas. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves are evergreen or subevergreen.[29]\nSect. Quercus (synonyms Lepidobalanus and Leucobalanus), the white oaks of Europe, Asia and North America. Trees or shrubs that produce nuts, specifically acorns, as fruits. Acorns mature in one year for annual trees and two years for biannual trees. Acorn is encapsulated by a spiny cupule as characterized by the family Fagaceae. Flowers in the Quercus genera produce one flower per node, with three or six styles, as well as three or six ovaries, respectively. The leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips, which are usually rounded. The type species is Quercus robur.[29][31]\nSubgenus Cerris[edit]\nMain article: Quercus subg. Cerris\nThe type species is Quercus cerris.\n\nSect. Cyclobalanopsis, the ring-cupped oaks of eastern and southeastern Asia. These are evergreen trees growing 10–40 metres (33–131 feet) tall. They are distinct from subgenus Quercus in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. Species of Cyclobalanopsis are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests, which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of the genus Castanopsis and the laurel family (Lauraceae).[29]\nSect. Cerris, the Turkey oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles are long; acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn\'s shell is hairless. Its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.[29]\nSect. Ilex, the Ilex oak and its relatives of Eurasia and northern Africa. Styles are medium-long; acorns mature in 12–24 months, appearing hairy on the inside. The leaves are evergreen, with bristle-like extensions on the teeth.[29]\nEcology[edit]\nCaterpillars of the North American oak leafroller, Archips semiferanus, can defoliate oak forests.\nOaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They are important components of hardwood forests; some species grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak–heath forests.[32][33] Several kinds of truffles, including two well-known varieties – black Périgord truffle[34] and the white Piedmont truffle[35] – have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. Similarly, many other fungi, such as Ramaria flavosaponaria, associate with oaks.[36][37]\nOaks support more than 950 species of caterpillars, an important food source for many birds.[38] Mature oak trees shed widely varying numbers of acorns (known collectively as mast) annually, with large quantities in mast years. This may be a predator satiation strategy, increasing the chance that some acorns will survive to germination.[39]\n\nJays feed on acorns and help to disperse these seeds.\nAnimals including squirrels[40] and jays – Eurasian jays in the Old World, blue jays in North America – feed on acorns, and are important agents of seed dispersal as they carry the acorns away and bury many of them as food stores.[41][42][43] However, some species of squirrel selectively excise the embryos from the acorns that they store, meaning that the food store lasts longer and that the acorns will never germinate.[40]\n\nHybridisation[edit]\nA hybrid white oak, possibly Quercus stellata × Q. muehlenbergii\nInterspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks, but usually between species within the same section only,[44] and most common in the white oak group. White oaks cannot discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring. Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.[45][46]\nFrequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with much introgression and the evolution of new species.[47] Introgression has caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information.[48] As a result, genetic data often does not differentiate between clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations.[49] The maintenance of particular loci for adaptation to ecological niches may explain the retention of species identity despite significant gene flow.[50]\nThe Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a slowly-evolving clade compared to other angiosperms,[51][52] and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in Quercus pose a significant challenge to the concept of a species as a group of \"actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\"[53] By this definition, many species of Quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and genetic data.[53]\n\nDiseases and pests[edit]\nOak powdery mildew on pedunculate oak, caused by Erysiphe alphitoides\nOaks are affected by a large number of pests and diseases. For instance, Q. robur and Q. petraea in Britain host 423 insect species.[54] This diversity includes 106 macro-moths, 83 micro-moths, 67 beetles, 53 cynipoidean wasps, 38 heteropteran bugs, 21 auchenorrhynchan bugs, 17 sawflies, and 15 aphids.[54] The insect numbers are seasonal: in spring, chewing insects such as caterpillars become numerous, followed by insects with sucking mouthparts such as aphids, then by leaf miners, and finally by gall wasps such as Neuroterus.[55] Several powdery mildews affect oak species. In Europe, the species Erysiphe alphitoides is the most common.[56] It reduces the ability of leaves to photosynthesize, and infected leaves are shed early.[57]\nAnother significant threat, the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea), has emerged in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems.[58] A little-understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has affected the UK since 2009.[59] \nIn California, goldspotted oak borer (Agrilus auroguttatus) has destroyed many oak trees,[60] while sudden oak death, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, has devastated oaks in California and Oregon, and is present in Europe.[61] Japanese oak wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea quercivora, has rapidly killed trees across Japan.[62]\n\nGall communities[edit]\nFurther information: Gall and Gall wasp\nMany galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, and roots. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall. These galls are the handiwork of tiny wasps from the  Cynipidae. In a complex ecological relationship, these gall wasps become hosts to parasitoid wasps—primarily from the order Chalcidoidea—which lay their larvae inside the gall wasps, ultimately leading to the hosts\' demise. Additionally, inquilines live commensally within the galls without harming the gall wasps.[63]\n\n\n\n\nOak apple gall on Quercus garryana\n\n\n\nOak apples on oak leaf\n\n\n\nBiorhiza pallida male, the cause of oak apple galls\n\n\nToxicity[edit]\nThe leaves and acorns of oaks are poisonous to livestock, including cattle and horses, if eaten in large amounts, due to the toxin tannic acid, which causes kidney damage and gastroenteritis.[64][65] An exception is the domestic pig, which, under the right conditions, may be fed entirely on acorns,[66] and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish dehesa[67] and the English system of pannage).[68] Humans can eat acorns after leaching out the tannins in water.[69]\n\nUses[edit]\nTimber[edit]\nHeart of oak beams of the frame of the Église Saint-Girons in Monein, France\nOak timber is a strong and hard wood with many uses, such as for furniture, floors, building frames, and veneers.[70]\nThe wood of a red oak Quercus cerris (the Turkey oak) has better mechanical properties than those of the white oaks Q. petraea and Q. robur; the heartwood and sapwood have similar mechanical properties.[71] Of the North American red oaks, the northern red oak, Quercus rubra, is highly prized for lumber.[72][73]\nThe wood is resistant to insect and fungal attack.[74]\nWood from Q. robur and Q. petraea was used in Europe for shipbuilding, especially of naval men of war, until the 19th century.[75] In hill states of India such as Uttarakhand, along with being used for fuelwood and timber, oak wood is used for agricultural implements, while the leaves serve as fodder for livestock during lean periods.[76][77]\n\nOther traditional products[edit]\nOak bark, with its high tannin content, was traditionally used in the Old World for tanning leather.[78] Oak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink for manuscripts, harvested at a specific time of year.[79] In Korea, sawtooth oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction.[80] The dried bark of the white oak was used in traditional medical preparations; its tannic acid content made it astringent and antiseptic.[81] Acorns have been ground to make a flour,[82] and roasted for acorn coffee.[83]\n\nCulinary[edit]\nBarrels for aging wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy and Scotch whisky are made from oak, with single barrel malt whiskies fetching a premium.[84] The use of oak in wine adds a range of flavours. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to their contents\' colour, taste, and aroma, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour. A dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give greater refinement and are chosen for the best, most expensive wines. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces a more powerful bouquet.[85][86]\nOak wood chips are used for smoking foods such as fish, meat, and cheese.[87][88]\nThe bark of the cork oak is used to produce cork stoppers for wine bottles. This species grows around the Mediterranean Sea; Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco produce most of the world\'s supply.[89]\n\n\n\n\nSherry maturing in oak barrels\n\n\n\nA cross section of the trunk of a cork oak, Quercus suber, showing the thick spongy bark used for making wine bottle corks\n\n\nConservation[edit]\nAn estimated 31% of the world\'s oak species are threatened with extinction, while 41% of oak species are considered to be of conservation concern. The countries with the highest numbers of threatened oak species (as of 2020) are China with 36 species, Mexico with 32 species, Vietnam with 20 species, and the US with 16 species. Leading causes are climate change and invasive pests in the US, and deforestation and urbanization in Asia.[90][91][92] \nIn the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine trees due to global warming. The associated pine forest species may cross frontiers and integrate into the oak forests.[93] \nOver the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America, and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood, and charcoal.[94] In the US, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests.[95] However, disturbance-tolerant oaks may have benefited from grazers like bison, and suffered when the bison were removed following European colonization.[96][97]\n\nCulture[edit]\nSymbols[edit]\nThe oak features in many coats of arms, such as that of Estonia.[98]\nThe oak is a widely used symbol of strength and endurance.[99] It is the national tree of many countries,[100] including the US,[101] Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (golden oak), Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales.[100] Ireland\'s fifth-largest city, Derry, is named for the tree, from Irish: Doire, meaning \'oak\'.[102]  Oak branches are displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the euro.[103]\nOak leaves symbolize rank in armed forces including those of the United States. Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns, and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy staff corps officers.[104][105] The oak tree is used as a symbol by several political parties and organisations. It is the symbol of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom,[106] and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland.[107]\n\nReligion[edit]\nGrīdnieku ancient oak in Rumbas parish, Latvia, girth 8.27 metres (27.1 ft) 2015\nThe prehistoric Indo-European tribes worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder god, and this tradition descended to many classical cultures. In Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus\'s oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak\'s leaves.[108] Mortals who destroyed such trees were said to be punished by the gods since the ancient Greeks believed beings called hamadryads inhabited them.[109] In Norse and Baltic mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder gods Thor and Perkūnas respectively.[110][111] In Celtic polytheism, the name druid, Celtic priest, is connected to Proto-Indo-European *deru, meaning oak or tree.[112] Veneration of the oak survives in Serbian Orthodox Church tradition. Christmas celebrations include the badnjak, a branch taken from a young and straight oak ceremonially felled early on Christmas Eve morning, similar to a yule log.[113]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: List of individual trees\nCategory: Individual oak trees\nSeveral oak trees hold cultural importance; such as the Royal Oak in Britain,[114] the Charter Oak in the United States,[115] and the Guernica oak in the Basque Country.[116] \"The Proscribed Royalist, 1651\", a famous painting by John Everett Millais, depicts a Royalist hiding in an oak tree while fleeing from Cromwell\'s forces.[117][118]\nIn the Roman Republic, a crown of oak leaves was given to those who had saved the life of a citizen in battle; it was called the \"Civic Crown\".[112] In his 17th century poem The Garden, Andrew Marvell critiqued the desire to be awarded such a leafy crown: \"How vainly men themselves amaze / To win the palm, the oak, or bays; And their uncessant labors see / Crowned from some single herb or tree, ...\"[119][120]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The New World sections are Protobalanus, Lobatae, Ponticae, Quercus, and Virentes.

Orchids are cosmopolitan plants that are found in almost every habitat on Earth except glaciers. The world\'s richest diversity of orchid genera and species is found in the tropics.\nOrchidaceae is one of the two largest families of flowering plants, along with the Asteraceae. It contains about 28,000 currently accepted species distributed across 763 genera.[3][4]\nThe Orchidaceae family encompasses about 6–11% of all species of seed plants.[5] The largest genera are Bulbophyllum (2,000 species), Epidendrum (1,500 species), Dendrobium (1,400 species) and Pleurothallis (1,000 species). It also includes Vanilla (the genus of the vanilla plant), the type genus Orchis, and many commonly cultivated plants such as Phalaenopsis and Cattleya. Moreover, since the introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 19th century, horticulturists have produced more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars.\n\n\nDescription[edit]\nA Phalaenopsis flower\nOrchids are easily distinguished from other plants, as they share some very evident derived characteristics or synapomorphies. Among these are: bilateral symmetry of the flower (zygomorphism), many resupinate flowers, a nearly always highly modified petal (labellum), fused stamens and carpels, and extremely small seeds.\n\nStem and roots[edit]\nGerminating seeds of the temperate orchid Anacamptis coriophora\nAll orchids are perennial herbs that lack any permanent woody structure. They can grow according to two patterns:\n\nMonopodial: The stem grows from a single bud, leaves are added from the apex each year, and the stem grows longer accordingly. The stem of orchids with a monopodial growth can reach several metres in length, as in Vanda and Vanilla.\nSympodial: Sympodial orchids have a front (the newest growth) and a back (the oldest growth).[6] The plant produces a series of adjacent shoots, which grow to a certain size, bloom and then stop growing and are replaced. Sympodial orchids grow horizontally, rather than vertically, following the surface of their support. The growth continues by development of new leads, with their own leaves and roots, sprouting from or next to those of the previous year, as in Cattleya. While a new lead is developing, the rhizome may start its growth again from a so-called \'eye\', an undeveloped bud, thereby branching. Sympodial orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a rhizome, which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil.\nNeotinea lactea, collected in Sardinia; the small size, compared to a one-Euro coin, and the two globose tuberoids typical of the Neotinea genus are highlighted\nTerrestrial orchids may be rhizomatous or form corms or tubers. The root caps of terrestrial orchids are smooth and white.\nSome sympodial terrestrial orchids, such as Orchis and Ophrys, have two subterranean tuberous roots. One is used as a food reserve for wintry periods, and provides for the development of the other one, from which visible growth develops.\nIn warm and constantly humid climates, many terrestrial orchids do not need pseudobulbs.\nEpiphytic orchids, those that grow upon a support, have modified aerial roots that can sometimes be a few meters long. In the older parts of the roots, a modified spongy epidermis, called a velamen, has the function of absorbing humidity. It is made of dead cells and can have a silvery-grey, white or brown appearance. In some orchids, the velamen includes spongy and fibrous bodies near the passage cells, called tilosomes.\nThe cells of the root epidermis grow at a right angle to the axis of the root to allow them to get a firm grasp on their support. Nutrients for epiphytic orchids mainly come from mineral dust, organic detritus, animal droppings and other substances collecting among on their supporting surfaces.\n\nPseudobulb of Prosthechea fragrans\nThe base of the stem of sympodial epiphytes, or in some species essentially the entire stem, may be thickened to form a pseudobulb that contains nutrients and water for drier periods.\nThe pseudobulb typically has a smooth surface with lengthwise grooves, and can have different shapes, often conical or oblong. Its size is very variable; in some small species of Bulbophyllum, it is no longer than two millimeters, while in the largest orchid in the world, Grammatophyllum speciosum (giant orchid), it can reach three meters. Some Dendrobium species have long, canelike pseudobulbs with short, rounded leaves over the whole length; some other orchids have hidden or extremely small pseudobulbs, completely included inside the leaves.\nWith ageing the pseudobulb sheds its leaves and becomes dormant. At this stage it is often called a backbulb. Backbulbs still hold nutrition for the plant, but then a pseudobulb usually takes over, exploiting the last reserves accumulated in the backbulb, which eventually dies off, too. A pseudobulb typically lives for about five years. Orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs are also said to have growths, an individual component of a sympodial plant.\n\nLeaves[edit]\nLike most monocots, orchids generally have simple leaves with parallel veins, although some Vanilloideae have reticulate venation. Leaves may be ovate, lanceolate, or orbiculate, and very variable in size on the individual plant. Their characteristics are often diagnostic. They are normally alternate on the stem, often folded lengthwise along the centre (\"plicate\"), and have no stipules. Orchid leaves often have siliceous bodies called stegmata in the vascular bundle sheaths (not present in the Orchidoideae) and are fibrous.\nThe structure of the leaves corresponds to the specific habitat of the plant. Species that typically bask in sunlight, or grow on sites which can be occasionally very dry, have thick, leathery leaves and the laminae are covered by a waxy cuticle to retain their necessary water supply. Shade-loving species, on the other hand, have long, thin leaves.\nThe leaves of most orchids are perennial, that is, they live for several years, while others, especially those with plicate leaves as in Catasetum, shed them annually and develop new leaves together with new pseudobulbs.\nThe leaves of some orchids are considered ornamental. The leaves of Macodes sanderiana, a semiterrestrial or rock-hugging (\"lithophyte\") orchid, show a sparkling silver and gold veining on a light green background. The cordate leaves of Psychopsiella limminghei are light brownish-green with maroon-puce markings, created by flower pigments. The attractive mottle of the leaves of lady\'s slippers from tropical and subtropical Asia (Paphiopedilum), is caused by uneven distribution of chlorophyll. Also, Phalaenopsis schilleriana is a pastel pink orchid with leaves spotted dark green and light green. The jewel orchid (Ludisia discolor) is grown more for its colorful leaves than its white flowers.\nSome orchids, such as Dendrophylax lindenii (ghost orchid), Aphyllorchis and Taeniophyllum depend on their green roots for photosynthesis and lack normally developed leaves, as do all of the heterotrophic species.\nOrchids of the genus Corallorhiza (coralroot orchids) lack leaves altogether and instead wrap their roots around the roots of mature trees and use specialized fungi to harvest sugars.[7]\n\nFlowers[edit]\nOrchid flowers have three sepals, three petals and a three-chambered ovary. The three sepals and two of the petals are often similar to each other but one petal is usually highly modified, forming a \"lip\" or labellum. In most orchid genera, as the flower develops, it undergoes a twisting through 180°, called resupination, so that the labellum lies below the column. The labellum functions to attract insects, and in resupinate flowers, also acts as a landing stage, or sometimes a trap.[8][9][10][11]\n\nLabelled image of Caladenia alpinaLabelled image of Diuris carinata\nThe reproductive parts of an orchid flower are unique in that the stamens and style are joined to form a single structure, the column.[10][11][12] Instead of being released singly, thousands of pollen grains are contained in one or two bundles called pollinia that are attached to a sticky disc near the top of the column. Just below the pollinia is a second, larger sticky plate called the stigma.[8][9][10][11]\n\nReproduction[edit]\nPollination[edit]\nMain article: Pollination of orchids\nThe complex mechanisms that orchids have evolved to achieve cross-pollination were investigated by Charles Darwin and described in Fertilisation of Orchids (1862). Orchids have developed highly specialized pollination systems, thus the chances of being pollinated are often scarce, so orchid flowers usually remain receptive for very long periods, rendering unpollinated flowers long-lasting in cultivation. Most orchids deliver pollen in a single mass. Each time pollination succeeds, thousands of ovules can be fertilized.\nPollinators are often visually attracted by the shape and colours of the labellum. However, some Bulbophyllum species attract male fruit flies (Bactrocera and Zeugodacus spp.) solely via a floral chemical which simultaneously acts as a floral reward (e.g. methyl eugenol, raspberry ketone, or zingerone) to perform pollination.[13] The flowers may produce attractive odours. Although absent in most species, nectar may be produced in a spur of the labellum (8 in the illustration above), or on the point of the sepals, or in the septa of the ovary, the most typical position amongst the Asparagales.\n\nPhalaenopsis pollinia (orange) attached to a toothpick with its sticky viscidium\nIn orchids that produce pollinia, pollination happens as some variant of the following sequence: when the pollinator enters into the flower, it touches a viscidium, which promptly sticks to its body, generally on the head or abdomen. While leaving the flower, it pulls the pollinium out of the anther, as it is connected to the viscidium by the caudicle or stipe. The caudicle then bends and the pollinium is moved forwards and downwards. When the pollinator enters another flower of the same species, the pollinium has taken such position that it will stick to the stigma of the second flower, just below the rostellum, pollinating it. In horticulture, artificial orchid pollination is achieved by removing the pollinia with a small instrument such as a toothpick from the pollen parent and transferring them to the seed parent.\n\nOphrys apifera is about to self-pollinate\nSome orchids mainly or totally rely on self-pollination, especially in colder regions where pollinators are particularly rare. The caudicles may dry up if the flower has not been visited by any pollinator, and the pollinia then fall directly on the stigma. Otherwise, the anther may rotate and then enter the stigma cavity of the flower (as in Holcoglossum amesianum).\nThe slipper orchid Paphiopedilum parishii reproduces by self-fertilization. This occurs when the anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly contacts the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent or floral assembly.[14]\nThe labellum of the Cypripedioideae is poke bonnet-shaped, and has the function of trapping visiting insects. The only exit leads to the anthers that deposit pollen on the visitor.\nIn some extremely specialized orchids, such as the Eurasian genus Ophrys, the labellum is adapted to have a colour, shape, and odour which attracts male insects via mimicry of a receptive female. Pollination happens as the insect attempts to mate with flowers.\nMany neotropical orchids are pollinated by male orchid bees, which visit the flowers to gather volatile chemicals they require to synthesize pheromonal attractants. Males of such species as Euglossa imperialis or Eulaema meriana have been observed to leave their territories periodically to forage for aromatic compounds, such as cineole, to synthesize pheromone for attracting and mating with females.[15][16] Each type of orchid places the pollinia on a different body part of a different species of bee, so as to enforce proper cross-pollination.\nA rare achlorophyllous saprophytic orchid growing entirely underground in Australia, Rhizanthella slateri, is never exposed to light, and depends on ants and other terrestrial insects to pollinate it.\nCatasetum, a genus discussed briefly by Darwin, actually launches its viscid pollinia with explosive force when an insect touches a seta, knocking the pollinator off the flower.\nAfter pollination, the sepals and petals fade and wilt, but they usually remain attached to the ovary.\nIn 2011,  Bulbophyllum nocturnum was discovered to flower nocturnally.[17]\n\nAsexual reproduction[edit]\nSome species, such as in the genera Phalaenopsis, Dendrobium, and Vanda, produce offshoots or plantlets formed from one of the nodes along the stem, through the accumulation of growth hormones at that point. These shoots are known as keiki.[18]\nEpipogium aphyllum exhibits a dual reproductive strategy, engaging in both sexual and asexual seed production. The likelihood of apomixis playing a substantial role in successful reproduction appears minimal. Within certain petite orchid species groups, there is a noteworthy preparation of female gametes for fertilization preceding the act of pollination. [19]\n\nFruits and seeds[edit]\nCross-sections of orchid capsules showing the longitudinal slits\nThe ovary typically develops into a capsule that is dehiscent by three or six longitudinal slits, while remaining closed at both ends.\nThe seeds are generally almost microscopic and very numerous, in some species over a million per capsule. After ripening, they blow off like dust particles or spores. Most orchid species lack endosperm in their seed and must enter symbiotic relationships with various mycorrhizal basidiomyceteous fungi that provide them the necessary nutrients to germinate, so almost all orchid species are mycoheterotrophic during germination and reliant upon fungi to complete their lifecycles. Only a handful of orchid species have seed that can germinate without mycorrhiza, namely the species within the genus Disa with hydrochorous seeds.[20][21]\n\nDisa uniflora seedling on a sphagnum leaf, on a thumbtack\nAs the chance for a seed to meet a suitable fungus is very small, only a minute fraction of all the seeds released grow into adult plants. In cultivation, germination typically takes weeks.\nHorticultural techniques have been devised for germinating orchid seeds on an artificial nutrient medium, eliminating the requirement of the fungus for germination and greatly aiding the propagation of ornamental orchids. The usual medium for the sowing of orchids in artificial conditions is agar gel combined with a carbohydrate energy source. The carbohydrate source can be combinations of discrete sugars or can be derived from other sources such as banana, pineapple, peach, or even tomato puree or coconut water. After the preparation of the agar medium, it is poured into test tubes or jars which are then autoclaved (or cooked in a pressure cooker) to sterilize the medium. After cooking, the medium begins to gel as it cools.\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\nMain article: Taxonomy of the Orchid family\nThe taxonomy of this family is in constant flux, as new studies continue to clarify the relationships between species and groups of species, allowing more taxa at several ranks to be recognized. The Orchidaceae is currently placed in the order Asparagales by the APG III system of 2009.[1]\nFive subfamilies are recognised. The cladogram below was made according to the APG system of 1998. It represents the view that most botanists had held up to that time. It was supported by morphological studies, but never received strong support in molecular phylogenetic studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApostasioideae: 2 genera and 16 species, south-eastern Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCypripedioideae: 5 genera and 130 species, from the temperate regions of the world, as well as tropical America and tropical Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Monandrae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanilloideae: 15 genera and 180 species, humid tropical and subtropical regions, eastern North America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpidendroideae: more than 500 genera and more or less 20,000 species, cosmopolitan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrchidoideae: 208 genera and 3,630 species, cosmopolitan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, a phylogenetic study[22] showed strong statistical support for the following topology of the orchid tree, using 9 kb of plastid and nuclear DNA from 7 genes, a topology that was confirmed by a phylogenomic study in the same year.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApostasioideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanilloideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCypripedioideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpidendroideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrchidoideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution[edit]\nA study in the scientific journal Nature has hypothesised that the origin of orchids goes back much longer than originally expected.[24] An extinct species of stingless bee, Proplebeia dominicana, was found trapped in Miocene amber from about 15-20 million years ago. The bee was carrying pollen of a previously unknown orchid taxon, Meliorchis caribea, on its wings. This find is the first evidence of fossilised orchids to date[24] and shows insects were active pollinators of orchids then. This extinct orchid, M. caribea, has been placed within the extant tribe Cranichideae, subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily Orchidoideae). An even older orchid species, Succinanthera baltica, was described from the Eocene Baltic amber by Poinar & Rasmussen (2017).[25]\nGenetic sequencing indicates orchids may have arisen earlier, 76 to 84 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[26] According to Mark W. Chase et al. (2001), the overall biogeography and phylogenetic patterns of Orchidaceae show they are even older and may go back roughly 100 million years.[27]\nUsing the molecular clock method, it was possible to determine the age of the major branches of the orchid family. This also confirmed that the subfamily Vanilloideae is a branch at the basal dichotomy of the monandrous orchids, and must have evolved very early in the evolution of the family. Since this subfamily occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa, and the continents began to split about 100 million years ago, significant biotic exchange must have occurred after this split (since the age of Vanilla is estimated at 60 to 70 million years). Recent biogeographic studies conducted on densely sampled phylogenies indicated that the most recent common ancestor of all extant orchids probably originated somewhere 83 million years ago in the supercontinent Laurasia.[28] Despite their long evolutionary history on Earth, the extant orchid diversity is also inferred to have originated during the last 5 million years,[28] with the American and Asian tropics as the geopgraphic areas exhibiting the highest speciation rates (i.e., number of speciation events per million years) on Earth.\nGenome duplication occurred prior to the divergence of this taxon.[29]\n\nGenera[edit]\nMain article: List of Orchidaceae genera\nThere are around 800 genera of orchids. The following are amongst the most notable genera of the orchid family:[30]\n\n\nAa\nAbdominea\nAcampe\nAcanthophippium\nAceratorchis\nAcianthus\nAcineta\nAcrorchis\nAda\nAerangis\nAeranthes\nAerides\nAganisia\nAgrostophyllum\nAnacamptis\nAncistrochilus\nAngraecum\nAnguloa\nAnsellia\nAorchis\nAplectrum\nArachnis\nArethusa\nArmodorum\nAscoglossum\nAustralorchis\nAuxopus\nBarkeria\nBartholina\nBeloglottis\nBiermannia\nBletilla\nBrassavola\nBrassia\nBulbophyllum\nCalanthe\nCalypso\nCatasetum\nCattleya\nChiloschista\nCirrhopetalum\nCleisostoma\nClowesia\nCoelogyne\nCoryanthes\nCycnoches\nCymbidium\nCyrtopodium\nCypripedium\nDactylorhiza\nDendrobium\nDisa\nDracula\nEncyclia\nEpidendrum\nEpipactis\nEria\nEulophia\nGastrochilus\nGongora\nGoodyera\nGrammatophyllum\nGymnadenia\nHabenaria\nHerschelia\nIonopsis\nLaelia\nLepanthes\nLiparis\nLudisia\nLycaste\nMasdevallia\nMaxillaria\nMeliorchis\nMexipedium\nMiltonia\nMormodes\nOdontoglossum\nOeceoclades\nOncidium\nOphrys\nOrchis\nPaphiopedilum\nPapilionanthe\nParaphalaenopsis\nPeristeria\nPhaius\nPhalaenopsis\nPholidota\nPhragmipedium\nPlatanthera\nPlatystele\nPleione\nPleurothallis\nPomatocalpa\nPromenaea\nPterostylis\nRenanthera\nRestrepia\nRestrepiella\nRhynchostylis\nRoezliella\nSaccolabium\nSarcochilus\nSatyrium\nSeidenfadenia\nSelenipedium\nSerapias\nSobralia\nSpiranthes\nStanhopea\nStelis\nThrixspermum\nTolumnia\nTrias\nTrichocentrum\nTrichoglottis\nVanda\nVanilla\nYoania\nZeuxine\nZygopetalum\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe type genus (i.e. the genus after which the family is named) is Orchis. The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek ὄρχις (órkhis), literally meaning \"testicle\", because of the shape of the twin tubers in some species of Orchis.[31][32][33] The term \"orchid\" was introduced in 1845 by John Lindley in School Botany,[34] as a shortened form of Orchidaceae.[35]\nIn Middle English, the name bollockwort was used for some orchids, based on \"bollock\" meaning testicle and \"wort\" meaning plant.[36]\n\nHybrids[edit]\nOrchid species hybridize readily in cultivation, leading to a large number of hybrids with complex naming.  Hybridization is possible across genera, and therefore many cultivated orchids are placed into nothogenera.  For instance, the nothogenus × Brassocattleya is used for all hybrids of species from the genera Brassavola and Cattleya.  Nothogenera based on at least three genera may have names based on a person\'s name with the suffix -ara, for instance × Colmanara = Miltonia × Odontoglossum × Oncidium.  (The suffix is obligatory starting at four genera.[37])\nCultivated hybrids in the orchid family are also special in that they are named by using grex nomenclature, rather than nothospecies.  For instance, hybrids between Brassavola nodosa and Brassavola acaulis are placed in the grex Brassavola Guiseppi.[38] The name of the grex (\"Guiseppi\" in this example) is written in a non-italic font without quotes.[39]\n\nAbbreviations[edit]\nAs a unique feature of the orchid family, a system of abbreviations exists that applies to names of genera and nothogenera.  The system is maintained by the Royal Horticultural Society.[40]  These abbreviations consist of at least one character, but may be longer.  As opposed to the usual one-letter abbreviations used for names of genera, orchid abbreviations uniquely determine the (notho)genus.  They are widely used in cultivation.  Examples are Phal for Phalaenopsis, V for Vanda and Cleis for Cleisostoma.\n\nDistribution[edit]\nOrchidaceae are cosmopolitan, occurring in almost every habitat apart from glaciers. The world\'s richest diversity of orchid genera and species is found in the tropics, but they are also found above the Arctic Circle, in southern Patagonia, and two species of Nematoceras on Macquarie Island at 54° south.\nThe following list gives a rough overview of their distribution:[citation needed]\n\nOceania: 50 to 70 genera\nNorth America: 20 to 26 genera\ntropical America: 212 to 250 genera\ntropical Asia: 260 to 300 genera\ntropical Africa: 230 to 270 genera\nEurope and temperate Asia: 40 to 60 genera\nEcology[edit]\nA majority of orchids are perennial epiphytes, which grow anchored to trees or shrubs in the tropics and subtropics. Species such as Angraecum sororium are lithophytes,[41] growing on rocks or very rocky soil. Other orchids (including the majority of temperate Orchidaceae) are terrestrial and can be found in habitat areas such as grasslands or forest.\nSome orchids, such as Neottia and Corallorhiza, lack chlorophyll, so are unable to photosynthesise. Instead, these species obtain energy and nutrients by parasitising soil fungi through the formation of orchid mycorrhizae. The fungi involved include those that form ectomycorrhizas with trees and other woody plants, parasites such as Armillaria, and saprotrophs.[42] These orchids are known as myco-heterotrophs, but were formerly (incorrectly) described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter. While only a few species are achlorophyllous holoparasites, all orchids are myco-heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth, and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi.[43][44] The symbiosis is typically maintained throughout the lifetime of the orchid because they depend on the fungus for nutrients, sugars and minerals.[45]\n\nUses[edit]\nAs decoration in a flowerpot\nA × Brassolaeliocattleya (\"BLC\") Paradise Jewel \'Flame\' hybrid orchid. Blooms of the Cattleya alliance are often used in ladies\' corsages.\nPerfumery[edit]\nThe scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumers (using headspace technology and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) to identify potential fragrance chemicals.[46]\n\nHorticulture[edit]\nThe other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers. Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical, but quite a few that grow in colder climates can be found on the market. Temperate species available at nurseries include Ophrys apifera (bee orchid), Gymnadenia conopsea (fragrant orchid), Anacamptis pyramidalis (pyramidal orchid) and Dactylorhiza fuchsii (common spotted orchid).\nOrchids of all types have also often been sought by collectors of both species and hybrids. Many hundreds of societies and clubs worldwide have been established. These can be small, local clubs, or larger, national organisations such as the American Orchid Society. Both serve to encourage cultivation and collection of orchids, but some go further by concentrating on conservation or research.\nThe term \"botanical orchid\" loosely denotes those small-flowered, tropical orchids belonging to several genera that do not fit into the \"florist\" orchid category. A few of these genera contain enormous numbers of species. Some, such as Pleurothallis and Bulbophyllum, contain approximately 1700 and 2000 species, respectively, and are often extremely vegetatively diverse. The primary use of the term is among orchid hobbyists wishing to describe unusual species they grow, though it is also used to distinguish naturally occurring orchid species from horticulturally created hybrids.\nNew orchids are registered with the International Orchid Register, maintained by the Royal Horticultural Society.[47]\n\nFood[edit]\nFurther information: Vanilla\nVanilla fruit drying\nThe dried seed pods of one orchid genus, Vanilla (especially Vanilla planifolia), are commercially important as a flavouring in baking, for perfume manufacture and aromatherapy.\nThe underground tubers of terrestrial orchids [mainly Orchis mascula (early purple orchid)] are ground to a powder and used for cooking, such as in the hot beverage salep or in the Turkish mastic ice cream dondurma. The name salep has been claimed to come from the Arabic expression ḥasyu al-tha‘lab, \"fox testicles\", but it appears more likely the name comes directly from the Arabic name saḥlab. The similarity in appearance to testes naturally accounts for salep being considered an aphrodisiac.\nThe dried leaves of Jumellea fragrans are used to flavour rum on Reunion Island.\nSome saprophytic orchid species of the group Gastrodia produce potato-like tubers and were consumed as food by native peoples in Australia and can be successfully cultivated, notably Gastrodia sesamoides. Wild stands of these plants can still be found in the same areas as early Aboriginal settlements, such as Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Australia. Aboriginal peoples located the plants in habitat by observing where bandicoots had scratched in search of the tubers after detecting the plants underground by scent.[note 1]\n\nCultural symbolism[edit]\nOrchids have many associations with symbolic values. For example, the orchid is the City Flower of Shaoxing, China. Cattleya mossiae is the national Venezuelan flower, while Cattleya trianae is the national flower of Colombia. Vanda Miss Joaquim is the national flower of Singapore, Guarianthe skinneri is the national flower of Costa Rica and Rhyncholaelia digbyana is the national flower of Honduras.[49] Prosthechea cochleata is the national flower of Belize, where it is known as the black orchid.[50] Lycaste skinneri has a white variety (alba) that is the national flower of Guatemala, commonly known as Monja Blanca (White Nun). Panama\'s national flower is the Holy Ghost orchid (Peristeria elata), or \'the flor del Espiritu Santo\'. Rhynchostylis retusa is the state flower of the Indian state of Assam where it is known as Kopou Phul.[51]\nOrchids native to the Mediterranean are depicted on the Ara Pacis in Rome, until now the only known instance of orchids in ancient art, and the earliest in European art.[note 2] A French writer and agronomist, Louis Liger, invented a classical myth in his book Le Jardinier Fleuriste et Historiographe published in 1704, attributing it to the ancient Greeks and Romans, in which Orchis the son of a nymph and a satyr rapes a priestess of Bacchus during one of his festivals the Bacchanalia and is then killed and transformed into an orchid flower as punishment by the gods, paralleling the various myths of youths dying and becoming flowers, like Adonis and Narcisuss; this myth however does not appear any earlier than Liger, and is not part of traditional Greek and Roman mythologies.[53]\n\n\nSome cultivars\n\n\nCattleya Mrs. Mahler \'Mem.

In response to threats of inundation of wild orchids at lower altitudes (350-400 m above sea level), 1000 endangered orchid plants of 16 genera and 29 species were translocated to higher elevation (approximately 1000 m above sea level). After relocation the 5 year survival of low and wide elevation species did not significantly differ and the mortality due to transplant shock was at only 10%. From this it was concluded that assisted migration might be a viable conservation tool for orchid species endangered by climate change.[55]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nAdaptation (film), based on The Orchid Thief\nOrchid Conservation Coalition\nOrchid Pavilion Gathering\nOrchidelirium, the Victorian era of flower madness in which collecting and discovering orchids reached extraordinary levels\nOrchids of the Philippines\nOrchids of Western Australia\nShangsi Festival\nBlack rot on orchids\nList of taxa named after human genitals\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Early western district (Vic.) settler gives account of local Aboriginal people gathering potato orchid tubers, digging where bandicoots had scratched.[48]\n\n^ The symbolic (or even religious) meaning of the Ara Pacis orchids is not yet known.[52]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2009). \"An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III\".

In the Middle Ages it was (together with Ravenna and Verona ) one of the royal seats of the Ostrogothic Kingdom , it was the capital of the Lombard Kingdom for two centuries and then, from 774 to 1024 [6] , capital of the Italian Kingdom , while from 1365 to 1413 it hosted the court viscontia ; since 1361 it has been home to a renowned university , recognized by the Times Higher Education in 2022 among the top 10 in Italy and among the 300 best in the world, out of a sample of 2,112 university institutes examined [7] .\n The ancient origins and an important historical past have left Pavia with a notable artistic heritage: among the main tourist attractions of the city, counted among the cities of art of the Po Valley, we can mention the Visconteo Castle , the basilica of San Michele Maggiore , the basilica of San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro , the church of Santa Maria del Carmine , the Duomo , the Romanesque towers , the Civic Museums and the Covered Bridge . The city is also the capital of a province dedicated above all to agriculture , in particular viticulture , rice cultivation and cereal cultivation , while the weight of the industrial sector, once very significant, is today much more limited. Pavia is included in the Ticino park and within the municipal borders there are some woods ( Bosco Negri and Bosco Grande [8] ) which are witnesses of the large lowland forest that once covered the Po Valley .\n\nIndex\n\n1 Physical geography\n\n1.1 Territory\n1.2 Climate\n\n\n2 Etymology\n3 History\n\n3.1 Roman times\n3.2 Medieval era\n3.3 Modern era\n3.4 Contemporary era\n3.5 Symbols\n3.6 Honors\n\n\n4 Monuments and places of interest\n\n4.1 Religious architecture\n\n4.1.1 Basilica of San Michele Maggiore\n4.1.2 Pavia Cathedral\n4.1.3 Basilica of San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro\n4.1.4 Church of Santa Maria del Carmine\n4.1.5 Church of San Teodoro\n4.1.6 Chiesa di Santa Maria di Canepanova\n4.1.7 Altre chiese\n4.1.8 Chiese inglobate in edifici residenziali o adattate ad altri usi\n4.1.9 Chiese andate distrutte\n\n\n4.2 Architetture civili\n\n4.2.1 Il Palazzo Regio\n4.2.2 Ponte Coperto\n4.2.3 Palazzi\n4.2.4 Broletto\n\n\n4.3 Architetture militari\n\n4.3.1 Le torri\n4.3.2 Castello Visconteo\n4.3.3 Castello di Mirabello\n4.3.4 Vie e piazze\n\n\n4.4 Altro\n\n4.4.1 Il Regisole\n4.4.2 Statua della Minerva\n4.4.3 Statua di Giuseppe Garibaldi\n4.4.4 Statua di Papa Pio V Ghislieri\n4.4.5 Statua della Lavandaia\n4.4.6 Monumento funebre di Ugo Foscolo\n4.4.7 Obelisco di Piazza Castello\n4.4.8 Fontana dei Marinai\n\n\n4.5 Aree naturali e parchi\n\n4.5.1 Aree naturali\n4.5.2 Parchi urbani\n\n\n\n\n5 Società\n\n5.1 Evoluzione demografica\n5.2 Etnie e minoranze straniere\n5.3 Religione\n5.4 Lingue e dialetti\n5.5 Tradizioni e folclore\n5.6 Istituzioni, enti e associazioni\n\n\n6 Cultura\n\n6.1 Istruzione\n\n6.1.1 Archivi e biblioteche\n6.1.2 Scuole\n6.1.3 Università di Pavia\n6.1.4 Scuola Universitaria superiore IUSS\n6.1.5 Musei\n\n\n6.2 Media\n\n6.2.1 Stampa\n6.2.2 Televisioni e Radio\n\n\n6.3 Arte\n6.4 Teatro e cinema\n6.5 Cucina\n6.6 Canzoni che parlano di Pavia\n6.7 Film girati a Pavia\n\n\n7 Geografia antropica\n\n7.1 Urbanistica\n7.2 Frazioni\n\n\n8 Economia\n\n8.1 Agricoltura\n8.2 Artigianato\n8.3 Industria\n8.4 Turismo\n\n\n9 Infrastrutture e trasporti\n\n9.1 Strade\n9.2 Ferrovie e tranvie\n9.3 Mobilità urbana ed extraurbana\n9.4 Bike sharing\n9.5 Car sharing\n9.6 Idroscalo\n9.7 Aeroporti\n9.8 Progetto IRMA\n\n\n10 Amministrazione\n\n10.1 Sindaci del Comune di Pavia dal dopoguerra\n10.2 Gemellaggi\n\n\n11 Sport\n\n11.1 Calcio\n11.2 Calcio a cinque\n11.3 Beach Soccer\n11.4 Basket\n11.5 Pallavolo\n11.6 Rugby\n11.7 Wrestling\n11.8 Impianti sportivi\n11.9 Eventi sportivi\n11.10 Sport acquatici\n\n\n12 Note\n13 Bibliografia\n14 Voci correlate\n15 Altri progetti\n16 Collegamenti esterni\n\n\nGeografia fisica[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nTerritorio[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPavia poggia su un terreno di origine fluvio-glaciale, formato da depositi alluvionali risalenti al Pleistocene con alternanze variamente frequenti, sia in senso orizzontale che verticale, di tipi litologici permeabili (ghiaie e sabbie) e impermeabili (limi e argille), e ciò rende possibile la formazione di numerose falde idriche e assicura alla zona un rifornimento idrico molto elevato[9].\n\nUna risorgiva nella valle della Vernavola presso Montebolone.\nLa città occupa un\'area di 62,86 km² a occidente della Lombardia, situata lungo la cosiddetta \"fascia delle risorgive\", laddove vi è l\'incontro, nel sottosuolo, tra strati geologici a differente permeabilità, aspetto che permette alle acque profonde di riaffiorare in superficie.\nPavia sorge sul ciglio del potente ripiano diluvionale che si stende fra il Ticino e l’Olona, a poca distanza dalla confluenza del Ticino nel Po. Tale ripiano risulta profondamente inciso da altri corsi d’acqua minori. Il ripiano diluvionale su cui posa Pavia appare inciso, in corrispondenza dell’aggregato urbano, da due profondi solchi dovuti all’azione erosiva di due fiumane postglaciali, rappresentate oggi dal Navigliaccio (che scorre nel letto anticamente occupato dalla Calvenza) e dalla Vernavola. I due valloni tendono a convergere proprio alle spalle del sito cittadino, così che la Pavia primitiva veniva a trovarsi su un tronco o moncone di terrazzo pressoché isolato e difficilmente raggiungibile, di forma quasi triangolare, che aveva il Ticino a sud, la Calvenza e poi il Navigliaccio a nord-ovest e la Vernavola a nord-est. Da un punto di vista altimetrico, la città presenta varie altezze. Il punto più alto si trova nella zona del castello Visconteo, circa 80 metri sul livello del mare, per poi lentamente declinare. Da quota 80 metri, si passa a 77 metri in circa 500 metri. A valle di piazza Vittoria, presso la quale si incrociavano il cardo e il decumano della città romana, la pendenza si accentua, fino ad arrivare a poco meno di 60 metri sul livello del mare nei pressi del Ponte Coperto[10].\n\nClima[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Stazione meteorologica di Pavia.\n\nPavia ha un clima temperato caldo, stabilmente umido, con estate molto calda (classificazione Köppen-Geiger Cfa[11]) tipico della pianura Padana. D\'inverno il clima è rigido e umido con formazione di nebbie al suolo dovute sia alla presenza di numerose rogge e canali - e il fiume Ticino - sia alla scarsa ventilazione. Non sono rari gli episodi nevosi che avvengono in occasione di ondate di freddo o a causa della formazione di un cuscinetto d\'aria fredda e stagnante al suolo (inversione termica). L\'autunno e la primavera sono le stagioni più piovose mentre l\'estate è calda e afosa con frequenti e improvvisi temporali che rinfrescano rapidamente - seppure per breve durata - l\'aria.\nLa temperatura massima media si registra in luglio con 29,8 °C, quella più bassa in gennaio con -2,0 °C. Il mese più piovoso risulta essere ottobre con 88 mm di pioggia; quello meno luglio con 48 mm. Le precipitazioni medie annue si aggirano tra i 750 e gli 800 mm, mediamente distribuite in 81 giorni.\n\nPAVIA Mesi  Stagioni  Anno  Gen  Feb  Mar  Apr  Mag  Giu  Lug  Ago  Set  Ott  Nov  Dic InvPriEst Aut  T. max. media (°C) 3,97,713,418,423,327,229,828,624,617,610,04,95,518,428,517,417,5 T. min. media (°C) −2,0−0,43,47,111,415,017,116,513,58,73,6−0,3−0,97,316,28,67,8 Precipitazioni (mm) 575669747460485259888164177217160228782 Giorni di pioggia 7788865557872124162081\nEtimologia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIn età romana Pavia era chiamata Ticinum; solo in età longobarda cominciò a essere chiamata Papia, toponimo da cui deriva il nome moderno della città, che potrebbe provenire da un nome di gens romana, forse Papiria, e vorrebbe dunque dire \"terra della gens Papiria\". Secondo alcune ipotesi, il nome Papia sarebbe derivato dal greco Papìas (\"custode del palazzo\"), nome che le sarebbe stato dato da soldati bizantini venuti a combattere i Goti con riferimento a un palazzo Reale di Teodorico, ma l\'ipotesi è poco probabile. Secondo Gian Piero Bognetti il toponimo sarebbe derivato dal termine goto papan, \"vescovo\", perché nella parte finale della guerra greco-gotica Pavia fu una delle ultime città a cadere sotto il controllo dei bizantini e fu forse, quindi, sede dell\'ultimo vescovo della chiesa ariana gotica in Italia settentrionale, ma anche proposta è stata scartata da gran parte degli studiosi[12]. In realtà l\'origine del toponimo Papia resta ancora un mistero, si può solo osservare che, a differenza della stragrande maggioranza dei municipia romani della penisola italiana, Pavia è forse l\'unico caso di centro abitato che, pur non conoscendo fasi di abbandono, cambiò radicalmente il proprio nome durante l\'alto medioevo. Ticinum deriva invece chiaramente dal fiume Ticino, chiamato Ticinus dai Romani, nome di origine prelatina e di etimologia incerta.[13]\n\nStoria[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nEpoca romana[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Storia di Pavia, Monetazione di Ticinum e Assedio di Pavia.\nIl centro storico visto dal cielo. Si può osservare lo schema urbanistico regolare con struttura ortogonale risalente al I secolo a.C.\nIl primo insediamento nell\'area di Pavia si deve ad antiche popolazioni della Gallia transpadana, forse i Levi, i Marici o gli Insubri, che crearono il primitivo abitato nell\'area, precedentemente abitata da popolazioni appartenenti alla cultura di Golasecca, dove Belloveso sconfisse gli Etruschi intorno al 600 a.C[14]. Nel 218 a.C. i romani, guidati da Publio Cornelio Scipione, gettarono un ponte sul Ticino dove ora sorge Pavia, che distrussero dopo la sconfitta, subita a opera di Annibale, nella battaglia del Ticino[15]. La città fu fondata dai Romani, a cui si deve la pianta della città, rimasta intatta (insieme alla rete fognaria[16]) fino a oggi, a castrum (accampamento militare) romano; la città aveva il nome di Ticinum[17] e fu elevata a municipium nell\'89 a.C. Nell’inverno del 9 a.C. l’imperatore Augusto e la sua consorte Livia si spinsero fino a Ticinum (Pavia) per incontrare il figlio di Livia, Tiberio, reduce dalle campagne di Dalmazia e Pannonia. Qui li raggiunse la drammatica notizia del gravissimo incidente accaduto a Druso, secondo figlio di Livia, mentre conduceva le operazioni militari sul fronte renano. Inviato in tutta fretta dall’imperatore, Tiberio, con un viaggio memorabile per celerità (200 miglia in un giorno e una notte, attraverso le Alpi, fino all’accampamento estivo d’oltre Reno, che fu poi chiamato Castra Scelerata), riuscì a raccogliere l’ultimo sospiro del fratello; ne curò poi il trasporto a Pavia precedendolo sempre a piedi, e di qui con l’imperatore seguì il funebre viaggio fino a Roma[18].\nNel 271 si combatté la prima delle battaglie che coinvolsero la città o le sue immediate vicinanze (Battaglia di Pavia). L’imperatore romano Aureliano sconfisse definitivamente gli Alemanni che dopo una serie di vittorie stavano fuggendo lungo la via Emilia dopo la sconfitta subita nella battaglia di Fano. La vittoria di Aureliano fu completa, con l\'intero esercito alemanno distrutto e il bottino delle loro incursioni recuperato.\nA partire da Aureliano, fino a Costantino I, fu anche sede di un\'importante zecca, battendo moneta sia durante il periodo degli Imperatori illirici, sia durante la tetrarchia e la successiva guerra civile. Ticinum era il punto di arrivo di un\'importante strada romana proveniente dalle Gallie e, grazie al porto sul Ticino, era uno snodo fondamentale nelle comunicazioni fluviali tra l\'Adriatico e il Lago Maggiore. La città, già sede di importanti alloggiamenti militari, nel IV secolo d.C. crebbe d\'importanza e divenne anche sede di una fabbrica statale di archi[19].\n\nUno dei tratti della fognatura di età romana presente nel sottosuolo del centro storico della città.\nMultiplo di un aureo della zecca di Ticinum del 313 del peso di 39.79 g. Rappresenta sul dritto il busto di Constantino I a fianco del Sol Invictus (oggi presso il Cabinet des médailles).\nSempre nel IV secolo d.C. cominciò ad affermarsi (secondo la tradizione grazie alla predicazione di San Siro) il cristianesimo, e sorsero le prime chiese, come quella dei Santi Gervasio e Protasio o quella di Santi Nazario e Celso, fondata dal terzo vescovo di Pavia, Evenzio, tra il 381 e il 397[20]. Sempre in città crebbe San Martino, che, seguendo il padre, un ufficiale romano trasferito intorno al 325 d.C. con il suo reparto dalla Pannonia a Pavia, e qui fu educato[21]. Nel 350 l’usurpatore gallico Magnezio, disceso in Italia, si scontrò a sua volta con le forze di Costanzo II a Pavia, riportando una parziale vittoria prima che gli insuccessi in Pannonia segnassero in maniera irreversibile il declino delle sue fortune. Nonostante gli insuccessi militari, Magnezio riuscì infine a sconfiggere nuovamente Costanzo II a Pavia nel 352[22].\nStilicone (tra 406 e 407), nelle operazioni militari contro Alarico, trasferì a Pavia parte dell\'esercito, evidenziando il cambiamento di ruolo assunto da Ticinum, da centro subalterno a Milano a palcoscenico principale dell\'Italia settentrionale[21]. Il 476 d.C. segna una data epocale per la città e non solo: Oreste, incalzato dalla ribellione di Odoacre, vi si rifugiò, poiché confidava nelle possenti fortificazioni della città, ma Pavia fu assediata e conquistata, segnando, con la morte di Oreste e la deposizione del figlio Romolo Augustolo, la fine dell\'Impero romano d\'Occidente[23].\n\nEpoca medievale[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Storia di Pavia, Zecca di Pavia e Assedio di Pavia.\n\nEpigrafe di Severino Boezio, rinvenuta a Villaregio, Pavia, Musei Civici.\nDurante le lotte tra Teodorico e Odoacre per il controllo dell\'Italia, il primo, nell\'inverno tra il 489 e il 490, si rinchiuse in Pavia, dove fu assediato da Tufa[24]. Nei primi mesi del 490, grazie all\'arrivo di soccorsi inviati dai Visigoti, Teodorico poté rompere l\'assedio.Verosimilmente, anche grazie ai rapporti che si instaurarono durante l’assedio tra la città, e in particolare il suo vescovo Epifanio[25], e Teodorico e data anche la posizione ben difendibile di Pavia, collegata inoltre a Ravenna e all\'Adriatico tramite le vie d’acqua, spinsero il sovrano ostrogoto a creare in città un palazzo Reale, facendo divenire così la città, insieme con Ravenna e Verona, una delle tre sedi del regno[26]. Nel primo trentennio del VI secolo in città sono infatti documentati parecchi interventi edilizi promossi dalla monarchia ostrogota relativi al palazzo Regio, alle mura, alle terme (che nel VII secolo sarebbero divenute le uniche ancora funzionanti in Europa al di fuori dell\'Impero Romano d\'Oriente[27]) e all\'anfiteatro. Nel 538 i bizantini assediarono Pavia, dove si era rinchiuso re Vitige, ma l\'assedio fallì[28]. Dal 540 la città divenne la sede della corte e del tesoro reale[29] e qui furono eletti i re Ildibaldo, Erarico e Totila. Nel difficile biennio 552-553 Pavia si distinse come il più importante centro militare del regno ostrogoto: qui fu eletto l’ultimo re goto Teia e Pavia fu l’ultima città gota a cadere nelle mani dei bizantini[30][31].\n\nUno dei Plutei di Teodote, una delle più alte testimonianze della scultura longobarda, Musei Civici.\nVenne conquistata dai Longobardi nel 572 che ne fecero la capitale del loro regno, con il nome di Papia, da cui il nome moderno[32]. Le principali conseguenze che il ruolo di capitale portò a Pavia, ovvero le “specificità” della capitale rispetto alle altre città del regno, furono in particolare la residenza del re in città e il funzionamento del palazzo Regio[33]. Il ruolo di capitale comportava la convocazione annuale delle assemblee degli exercitales longobardi, durante le quali furono promulgate nel 643 l’editto di Rotari e, successivamente, le altre leggi longobarde. Diversamente dai re franchi, quelli longobardi avevano residenza fissa nel palazzo Reale: ciò rafforzava l’autorità regia dato che ogni anno, intorno al primo marzo, presso il palazzo, si teneva una grande assemblea dove venivano emanate le leggi e venivano dibattute le grandi questioni del regno. Tuttavia si trattava anche di un momento molto delicato, dato che, come più volte si verificò, se una fazione avversa al sovrano riusciva a occupare il palazzo e il tesoro regio, di fatto poteva impadronirsi del regno: per i longobardi l’autorità del sovrano poteva essere esercitata solo se egli aveva il pieno controllo del palazzo[34]. La residenza in città delle élite aristocratiche del regno contribuiva a fare di Pavia, non solo il centro urbano principale, ma anche il punto di riferimento per l’intera popolazione del regno. \n\nLa cripta della chiesa di Sant\'Eusebio, fino al 658 cattedrale ariana della città.\nLa residenza regia a Pavia influenzò molto anche le vicende della sede episcopale della capitale, che, fino dalla sua fondazione, nel IV secolo, era sottoposta all’autorità della metropoli milanese. La dipendenza del vescovo di Pavia da quello di Milano andò in crisi all’arrivo dei Longobardi. Infatti, tra la fine del VII e l\'inizio dell\'VIII secolo, il vescovo di Pavia, come presule di una città capitale di regno, fu sottoposto direttamente alla sede romana e reso autonomo dall’autorità del metropolita milanese (tale “indipendenza” durò fino all’età moderna)[30]. La città conobbe profondi cambiamenti nella topografia urbana, come l’abbandono del foro di età classica e la creazione di nuovi edifici di culto cristiani. Il principale fenomeno che investì la topografia urbana di Pavia in età longobarda consistette nella fondazione di edifici ecclesiastici. Fino alla metà del VI secolo sono attestate solo due chiese cristiane in città, mentre, tra il 569 e il 774, furono fondate almeno 21 tra chiese e monasteri. Otto sono fondazioni regie, 4 aristocratiche e 1 sola episcopale. Determinante fu la creazione di edifici ecclesiastici da parte dei sovrani: la fondazione di una chiesa, spesso destinata alla sepoltura del fondatore, divenne infatti dal VII secolo l’atto principale con cui la monarchia longobarda dimostrò la propria appartenenza e adesione al mondo cristiano[35][36]. Il regno longobardo durò per due secoli, fino al 774, quando venne conquistata da Carlo Magno.\n\nZecca di Pavia, denaro di Ludovico il Pio.\nCofano in lamina sbalzata proveniente dal Daghestan, arte islamica, XI secolo, dalla chiesa di San Teodoro, Musei Civici.\nPavia rimase capitale del Regno d\'Italia anche durante il periodo carolingio e ottoniano[37]: nella chiesa di San Michele Maggiore a Pavia, Berengario del Friuli e i suoi successori fino a Berengario II e Adalberto II, furono incoronati Re d\'Italia[38].\n\nBasilica di San Michele, le cinque pietre, già menzionate nelle Honorantiae civitatis Papiae (1020 circa), sopra le quali veniva posto il trono durante le incoronazioni. La scritta e la rappresentazione della Corona Ferrea nella pietra centrale furono aggiunte nell\'Ottocento.\nLa città era la sede del palazzo Reale, del massimo tribunale del regno e della principale zecca regia fino al 1024. Inoltre, il 25 maggio dell\'anno 825 l\'imperatore Lotario I con il capitolare di Corteolona fondò presso il palazzo Reale la Schola Papiense, scuola di diritto, di retorica e arti liberali, alla quale dovevano recarsi tutti gli studenti di Milano, Brescia, Lodi, Bergamo, Novara, Vercelli, Tortona, Acqui, Genova, Asti e Como[39].\nDurante il periodo ottoniano Pavia godette di un periodo di benessere e sviluppo. L’antica capitale longobarda si distinse dalle altre città della pianura padana per la sua fondamentale funzione di crocevia di importanti commerci, sia di derrate alimentari sia di oggetti di lusso. I traffici commerciali vennero favoriti soprattutto dalle vie d’acqua utilizzate dall’imperatore per i suoi spostamenti: dal Ticino si raggiungeva facilmente il Po, asse diretto con il mare Adriatico e i traffici marittimi. Inoltre, con l’avvento degli Ottoni (Ottone I sposò a Pavia Adelaide di Borgogna nel 951 e la coppia risiedette a lungo, in diversi periodi, in città), Milano perse nuovamente importanza a favore di Pavia, la cui preminenza venne sancita, tra l’altro, dalle coniazioni della zecca pavese[40]. L\'importanza della città in quei secoli è evidenziata anche dal resoconto del geografo arabo Ibrāhīm al-Turtuši, che viaggiò nell’Europa centro-occidentale tra il 960 e il 965 e visitò Verona, Rocca di Garda e Pavia, da lui definita la principale città della Longobardia, popolosissima, ricca di mercanti e, come Verona, interamente edificata, a differenza di altri centri della regione, in pietra, mattone e calce[41].\nSempre a cavallo tra X e XI secolo, la città diede i natali a Liutprando da Cremona, vescovo, cronista e diplomatico al servizio di Berengario II prima e poi di Ottone I e Ottone II e di Lanfranco di Canterbury, stretto collaboratore di Guglielmo il Conquistatore e, dopo la conquista normanna del regno Anglosassone, riorganizzatore della chiesa inglese.\nNel 1018 papa Benedetto VIII convocò a Pavia un concilio dove fu rinnovata la condanna contro la simonia ed il concubinato ecclesiastico, un nuovo concilio, convocato sempre da papa Benedetto VIII e dall\'imperatore Enrico II, si svolse a Pavia nel 1022 e determinò pesanti misure volte a reprimere il Nicolaismo e la simonia.[28] Nel 1037, con le milizie pavesi, l\'imperatore Corrado II assediò Milano, sebbene l\'assedio fu poi tolto, le operazioni di devastazione delle campagne milanesi proseguirono fino al 1039. La rivalità tra Pavia e Milano si trasformò in una guerra nel 1056, che proseguì a lungo con alterne vicende (Battaglia di Campomorto (1061))[42] e Pavia chiamò in aiuto gli imperatori. Nel 1076, durante le lotte tra l\'imperatore Enrico IV ed il papa Gregorio VII, Guiberto da Parma, arcivescovo di Ravenna, convocò a Pavia un concilio insieme ai vescovi ed ai diaconi dissidenti verso il pontefice, durante il quale scomunicarono il papa Gregorio VII[28].\n\nScontro tra cavalieri, XII secolo, Pavia, Musei Civici.\nDurante le guerre tra l\'imperatore tedesco Federico Barbarossa (che venne incoronato re d’Italia nella basilica di San Michele Maggiore nel 1155) e i comuni della Lega Lombarda, Pavia (con Como) fu fedele all\'esercito imperiale. Nel complesso, il Barbarossa risiedette a Pavia per 13 anni in diversi periodi. Numerose furono quindi anche le soste dell\'intera corte imperiale nell\'antica capitale altomedievale. La lunga residenza dell\'imperatore e del suo entourage a Pavia fu caratterizzata da una serie di richiami espliciti al ruolo e alla memoria della città nel passato, connotando la seconda metà del XII secolo come un vero e proprio revival dei fasti della capitale del regno. Federico rilasciò anche molti diplomi ai ricchi monasteri regi pavesi, utili alleati nel controllo del territorio e nella politica ecclesiastica dell\'imperatore[43]. Inoltre, con il decreto imperiale dell’8 agosto 1164, il Barbarossa eliminò completamente ogni autorità palatina dal governo cittadino e riconobbe alla cittadinanza il diritto alla libera elezione dei consoli con la sola clausola che costoro giurassero e facessero giurare al popolo fedeltà all’Impero e ricevessero dall’Imperatore l’investitura e la conferma della carica. L’imperatore concedette inoltre a Pavia il dominio su un vasto distretto che, nel diploma del 1164, abbracciava non soltanto la Lomellina e l’Oltrepò attuale, con le terre tra Pavia e Milano, ma anche una grande parte del territorio Tortonese[44].\n\nBernardo Cane, l\'imperatore Federico I (1583), Musei Civici. Il dipinto, copia di una precedente tavola più antica, originariamente era esposto nel Broletto, nella sala del Consiglio.\nFederico II entrò per la prima volta in Pavia nel 1212 e il suo ingresso in città fu celebrato trionfalmente. Come era già accaduto con Federico I, la permanenza dello Svevo in città significò la ripresa di antiche tradizioni regie proprie della capitale altomedievale. Il sovrano, come di consuetudine, rilasciò diplomi a enti ecclesiastici locali e soggiornò nel palazzo presso il monastero di S. Salvatore[44].\nPavia appoggiò Federico II contro la seconda Lega Lombarda[45], e le sue forze parteciparono alla battaglia di Cortenuova, all\'assedio di Parma e a numerose altre operazioni militari, ottenendo nel 1212 a Casei Gerola una grande vittoria sui milanesi e i loro alleati. Nel 1219 Federico II confermò ancora una volta quanto l’avo aveva concesso a Pavia per la fedeltà dimostrata nel sostenere le ragioni dell’Impero sul campo di battaglia. Inoltre Federico II concesse al comune maggiori autonomia nell\'autogoverno cittadino, nella potestà giurisdizionale e nella capacità impositiva[46].\nA partire dalla seconda metà del Duecento la città fu sconvolta dalle lotte tra la fazione guelfa, capeggiata dai conti di Langosco e quella ghibellina, guidata dai Beccaria che infine, dopo alterne vicende, riuscirono a prendere intorno al 1327 il controllo di Pavia[47].\nNel 1329, con il Trattato di Pavia, l\'imperatore Ludovico IV concesse durante il suo soggiorno a Pavia l\'Elettorato del Palatinato ai discendenti del fratello duca Rodolfo, dividendo così la dinastia Wittelsbach in due rami.\nIntorno alla metà del Trecento, benché il regime dei Beccaria (ufficialmente Pavia era ancora un libero comune, ma di fatto i Beccaria, e i gruppi familiari che li appoggiavano, dominavano ogni aspetto della vita politica della città[47]) fosse alleato dei Visconti, le mire della dinastia milanese nei confronti di Pavia divennero sempre più esplicite. Nel 1356, Galeazzo II assediò la città sia da terra sia dal Ticino, ma i pavesi, aiutati dal marchese di Monferrato e spronati da Iacopo Bussolari, un predicatore agostiniano del monastero di San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro, sconfissero pesantemente sia l\'esercito sia la flotta viscontea[48].\n\nIl Parco Visconteo.\nGrazie alla vittoria ottenuta, Iacopo Bussolari capeggiò una rivolta che portò alla cacciata dei Beccaria (i quali subito si allearono con i Visconti) e instaurò a Pavia un governo popolare, con istituzioni e magistrature simili a quelle sperimentate, pochi anni prima, a Roma da Cola di Rienzo[49]. Tuttavia, la pace non durò a lungo: nel 1358 riesplose la guerra contro i Visconti e nell\'aprile del 1359, Galeazzo II, aiutato dai Beccaria, che nel frattempo avevano preso il controllo di gran parte del distretto pavese, riuscì ad assediare Pavia con un grosso esercito. Anche questa volta, guidati dal Bussolari, i pavesi resistettero tenacemente al Visconti, ma infine, non avendo ricevuto soccorsi da parte di Giovanni II di Monferrato, dovettero arrendersi il 13 novembre 1359[48].\n\nGiovanni Cristoforo Romano, tomba di Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Certosa di Pavia.\nDopo la conquista, Galeazzo II, desideroso di raggiungere una maggiore autonomia dal fratello Bernabò, e, soprattutto, portando avanti un preciso disegno politico teso a basare e legittimare il suo potere appropriandosi delle memorie della regalità altomedievale che Pavia conservava, ponendosi in diretta continuità con i re longobardi (dai quali i Visconti cominciarono a sostenere di discendere) e altomedievali che avevano avuto sede nel palazzo Reale della città, decise di abbandonare Milano e portare la corte a Pavia[50]. Si trattava, verosimilmente, di un progetto già a lungo meditato da Galeazzo II, tanto che già pochi mesi dopo la presa di Pavia diede avvio al cantiere del castello Visconteo, futura sede della sua nuova corte. Lo stesso \"sogno regio\" (e il continuo richiamo della monarchia longobarda e del regno d\'Italia) fu portato avanti, con maggior vigore, dal figlio Gian Galeazzo, che continuò a risiedere, prevalentemente, nel castello di Pavia e lo stesso fece Filippo Maria Visconti fino al 1413[51].\nSotto la dinastia milanese, l’importanza di Pavia è evidenziata dalla creazione della contea di Pavia (1396) destinata al primogenito (che fu celebrata da Gian Galeazzo con una cerimonia di intronizzazione nella basilica di San Michele che ricalcava le incoronazioni regie altomedievali\n[52]), la fondazione dell\'università, dell\'immenso parco Visconteo, la duplicazione della capitale e delle sedi della corte (Milano e Pavia), la fondazione della Certosa come pantheon dinastico e l’istituzione di una struttura burocratica e camerale che raddoppiava le istituzioni milanesi (solo nel Quattrocento sforzesco questa dualità fu superata, ma a Pavia restarono archivi, biblioteca, reliquie e strutture residenziali cortigiane)[53]. La duplice sede della corte tra Milano e Pavia, attribuiva a quest’ultima un ruolo distinto, una identità forte e prestigiosa all’interno del dominio e rispetto alle altre città, a scapito della centralità milanese[54]. Sotto i Visconti prima e gli Sforza poi, la trasformazione della città, del territorio e della società urbana ebbe qualcosa di grandioso: dal 1359 al 1402, Pavia (una città già piuttosto ricca e prosperosa nonostante la crisi del secolo) fece notevoli passi avanti sotto l’ombra dei principi, accelerando la trasformazione delle sue istituzioni, delle gerarchie sociali, dell’ambiente culturale, dell’aspetto monumentale e della forma urbis[55]. Oltre agli edifici propriamente ducali, in città, furono fondati i monasteri dell\'Annunciata e di Santa Chiara la Reale, fu costruita la piazza grande (l\'attuale Piazza Vittoria), e furono ridisegnate le strade centrali (Strada Nuova). Furono completate alcune fabbriche gotiche, come la chiesa di San Francesco, il Carmine e San Tommaso, con il contributo di architetti viscontei, e furono aperti cantieri che contribuirono al rinnovamento del linguaggio architettonico urbano. Al tempo di Gian Galeazzo fiorivano nuove residenze nobiliari per i membri della dinastia e per i cortigiani, come la grande casa di Azzone Visconti (poi inglobata nel Palazzo centrale dell\'università), la Corte nuova di Bianca di Savoia, il palazzo di Caterina Visconti, i palazzi di segretari e magistrati come Pasquino Capelli, di Nicolò Diversi (palazzo dei Diversi), Francesco Barbavara, Pasino Eustachi (Casa degli Eustachi) e Nicolò Spinelli. I Visconti e Sforza chiamarono ad insegnare a Pavia famosi professori, come il giurista Baldo degli Ubaldi, Lorenzo Valla o Giasone del Maino[56].\n\nLastra tombale del professore Francesco Corti (1495), Palazzo centrale dell\'università di Pavia.\nGian Galeazzo Visconti creò inoltre la carica di capitano della flotta, la sede era Pavia e doveva occuparsi non solo degli aspetti militari legati alla squadra navale ducale, ma anche dell\'ordine pubblico, della riscossione dei dazi, della manutenzione degli argini e dei ponti e del vettovagliamento delle città su tutti i fiumi, corsi d\'acqua e laghi del ducato di Milano[57], Tale carica scomparì solo dopo la caduta di Ludovico il Moro[58]. Inoltre, già precedentemente, nel 1378 Galeazzo II fece realizzare la darsena (poi ingrandita nel 1392, nel 1435 e nel 1451) dove venivano realizzate, riparate e custodite le imbarcazioni della flotta ducale che, ancora nel 1494 era formata da 33 galeoni[59]. La darsena, che era una meta usuale di visita per gli ospiti della corte ducale, come l\'ambasciatore fiorentino Giovanni Ridolfi nel 1480, fu distrutta dalle artiglierie francesi durante l\'assedio del 1524-25 e si trovava dove ora si estendono gli Horti Borromaici[60].\nSempre sotto il governo di Gian Galeazzo, nel 1387 si instaurò in città la prima comunità ebraica che, durante il periodo sforzesco, crebbe e prosperò, e che espresse anche medici e intellettuali, quali Elia ben Shabbetai, medico personale di Filippo Maria Visconti e professore all\'Università[61], e soprattutto il grande studioso e talmudista Joseph Colon[62], tanto che nel 1490 fu attivato anche un corso di ebraico presso l\'università[61].\n\nEpoca moderna[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Storia di Pavia, Maiolica di Pavia e Assedio di Pavia.\n\nBernardino Lanzani, Sant\'Antonio Abate protegge Pavia durante l\'assedio del 1522 (ex voto civico), Chiesa di San Teodoro.\nOccupata dai francesi nel 1499, nel 1512 nella battaglia di Pavia, sotto il comando di Matteo Schiner, i fanti svizzeri e veneziani scacciarono dalla città la guarnigione francese e saccheggiarono la città[63]. Tornata sotto il controllo sforzesco, nel 1522 fu assediata da Odet de Foix, conte di Lautrec. Nonostante la situazione di Pavia fosse disperata, perché gran parte della guarnigione imperiale aveva dovuto lasciare la città per soccorrere Milano, anch\'essa assediata dai francesi, e, inoltre, Federico II Gonzaga, che guidava la difesa di Pavia, disponeva solo di circa 1.500 fanti e 300 cavalieri, mentre l\'esercito del re di Francia era composta da quasi 20.000 uomini, l\'assedio fallì. La forte resistenza opposta dai cittadini armi, che avevano riformato la milizia urbana, e della guarnigione imperiale, legata all\'arrivo di rinforzi asburgici, costrinse i francesi a fuggire[64].\nNell\'Ottobre del 1524, il re di Francia Francesco I, alla guida di un esercito composto da oltre 23.000 fanti, 3.200 cavalieri e 53 cannoni, pose d\'assedio Pavia, tuttavia, nonostante la sproporzione della forze (la città era difesa da Antonio de Leyva con circa 6.000 fanti, tra lanzichenecchi e spagnoli, e dalla milizia urbana) le operazioni ossidionali andarono per le lunghe[65], permettendo così agli imperiali di inviare, nel febbraio del 1525, un esercito, guidato da Carlo di Lannoy, Carlo di Borbone e Fernando Francesco d\'Avalos e composto da quasi 20.000 fanti, 2.300 cavalieri e 17 cannoni, in soccorso a Pavia. L\'arrivo di queste forze diede origine a uno degli episodi più importanti delle guerre d\'Italia: la battaglia di Pavia, nella quale il re di Francia fu sonoramente sconfitto e fatto prigioniero. Dal punto di vista della storia militare la battaglia è importante perché dimostrò la schiacciante superiorità della fanteria Imperiale e soprattutto delle sue formazioni di picchieri e archibugieri spagnoli (tercios) e tedeschi (Doppelsöldner) che distrussero con il fuoco delle loro armi la famosa cavalleria pesante francese, decimando un\'intera generazione di grandi signori aristocratici francesi[66].\n\nLa cattura di Francesco I di Francia durante la battaglia di Pavia, dettaglio di uno degli Arazzi della Battaglia di Pavia, Napoli, Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte.\nLegata alla battaglia è la storia della zuppa alla pavese, semplice zuppa con pane secco, uova, formaggio e burro, cucinata da una contadina al re appena fatto prigioniero, riguardo alla quale si racconta che al re piacque così tanto da farla inserire nel menù di corte con il nome di soupe à la pavoise.\nTuttavia due anni più tardi, nel 1527, i francesi, guidati da Odet de Foix, assediarono nuovamente Pavia e, dopo averla conquistata, desiderosi di vendicarsi delle sconfitte del 1522 e del 1525, la sottoposero a un pesantissimo saccheggio che durò sette giorni. Durante l\'assedio, inoltre, il Castello Visconteo perse (per colpa delle artiglierie francesi) l\'ala nord - la più bella, perché conteneva gli appartamenti ducali, con stanze affrescate dal Pisanello - e le due torri di nordovest e nordest, mentre le campagne attorno alla città furono devastate e alcune chiese suburbane, o vicine alle mura, furono distrutte o danneggiate. Dopo il saccheggio, i francesi lasciarono in città una debole guarnigione, così esigua che, nel maggio del 1528, dopo un breve assedio, gli imperiali ripresero la città, che fu nuovamente saccheggiata. Tuttavia, nel settembre dello stesso anno, per l\'ennesima volta, l\'esercito francese assediò e occupò Pavia, tuttavia la permanenza dei soldati del re di Francia in città durò poco, nell\'ottobre del 1529 gli uomini di Carlo V strinsero Pavia e riuscirono a scacciare definitivamente i francesi[67].\nNegli stessi, tormentati, anni si formò presso l\'università Girolamo Cardano, mentre, probabilmente nel 1511, Leonardo da Vinci studiò anatomia insieme a Marco Antonio della Torre, professore di anatomia presso l\'università[68].\nA partire dalla seconda metà del XVI secolo divenne fiorente in città la produzione di maiolica, che portò Pavia a essere, fino al Settecento, uno dei principali centri di produzione di tali manufatti nell\'Italia settentrionale[69]. Ma la città aveva, come nel passato, un\'importanza soprattutto commerciale: le merci che da Milano e dal resto della Lombardia transitavano alla volta di Genova passavano da Pavia[70] e, soprattutto, nel fondaco posto lungo il Ticino affluiva dall\'Adriatico il sale, necessario non solo per la conservazione degli alimenti, ma anche per molte attività, come quella casearia. Il sale, da Pavia, era poi distribuito a Milano e in gran parte della Lombardia occidentale e nel Piemonte[71].\n\nRanunzio Prata, Assedio di Pavia del 1655, Pavia, 1656 (dettaglio).\nTuttavia, in questi decenni, soprattutto per volontà dei re di Spagna, fu rafforzata l\'inquisizione (che aveva sede nella chiesa di San Tommaso dei domenicani e che fu allontanata solo nel 1774 dall\'imperatrice Maria Teresa) che cominciò a tenere sotto controllo l\'ambiente universitario[72] e anche la comunità ebraica, che nel 1597, per ordine del re Filippo II dovette abbandonare Pavia[73].\nNel 1655 il principe Tommaso Francesco di Savoia attaccò Pavia con un\'armata di 20.000/25.000 soldati francesi, piemontesi e del duca di Modena, mentre la città era difesa da Galeazzo Trotti che disponeva solo di 3.000 fanti spagnoli, circa 900 cavalieri spagnoli e di alcune migliaia di uomini della milizia urbana. Tuttavia, Tommaso Francesco di Savoia non riuscì a conquistare Pavia e dovette ritirarsi dopo un assedio durato 52 giorni[74].\n\nLa pila di Volta. Gabinetto di Fisica di Alessandro Volta.\nNel 1706, dopo un breve assedio, fu occupata dagli austriaci, che mantennero il controllo della città fino al 1796, nonostante, durante le guerre di Successione polacca prima e austriaca poi, Pavia fu occupata nel 1733 dai francesi, nel 1743 da francesi e spagnoli, per essere poi ripresa definitivamente nel 1746 dagli austriaci. Nella seconda metà del Settecento, per impulsò sia di Maria Teresa, sia di Giuseppe II l’università conobbe un grande sviluppo, furono chiamati docenti di grande fama, come Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Antonio Scarpa, Giuseppe Frank, Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, Samuel-Auguste Tissot e Lorenzo Mascheroni e l’ateneo divenne uno dei principali d’Europa. Inoltre a Pavia, nel 1777, si laureò Maria Pellegrina Amoretti, la prima donna laureata in Giurisprudenza d\'Italia. \n\nFrancesco Trecourt, La darsena di Pavia alla confluenza del Naviglio Pavese nel Ticino con il piroscafo Contessa Clementina, 1859 circa, Musei Civici.\nNel maggio 1796 Napoleone punì la città per un\'insurrezione contro le forze francesi condannandola ad un saccheggio di tre giorni. Tuttavia, ben presto, Napoleone decise di sfruttare l\'Università, le biblioteche e le competenze presenti in città, creando la Scuola Militare per Ufficiali di Fanteria e, nel 1803, la Scuola d\'Artiglieria, con annessa fonderia di cannoni in bronzo[75]. Anche l\'università attraversò un periodo felice, l\'età napoleonica vide infatti gli insegnamenti di Vincenzo Monti e di Ugo Foscolo sulla cattedra di eloquenza, di Gian Domenico Romagnosi di diritto civile e di Vincenzo Brunacci di matematica.\n\nEpoca contemporanea[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Naviglio Pavese e Fonderia e Scuola d\'Artiglieria di Pavia.\n\nIl laboratorio di Camillo Golgi, Museo Golgi.\nNel 1814 tornò sotto gli austriaci. Nel 1818 furono portati a termine i lavori del Naviglio Pavese: il canale, concepito come via d\'acqua tra Milano, Pavia ed il Ticino e come canale irriguo, contribuì allo sviluppo della città, tanto che già pochi anni dopo la sua realizzazione, nel 1821, alle spalle del castello sorse Borgo Calvenzano, una lunga serie di edifici porticati dove si trovavano magazzini, osterie, uffici spedizionieri e doganali, alberghi, stalle, tutto in supporto della navigazione interna. Nel 1820 cominciarono a operare nella darsena di Pavia i primi piroscafi a vapore e, tra il 1854 ed il 1859, il Lloyd Austriaco organizzò una regolare linea di navigazione, sempre tramite piroscafi a vapore, tra Pavia, Venezia e Trieste. Pavia divenne nel 1859 parte del Regno di Sardegna (futuro Regno d\'Italia) insieme con il resto della Lombardia[37]. Nell’Ottocento, l’università conobbe una forte crescita nel numero degli iscritti e si dotò di nuovi dipartimenti, laboratori, aule e, tra il 1819 e il 1850, allargò la propria sede e creando una nuova, e più ampia, aula magna. Nel corso del secolo insegnarono a Pavia docenti di grande notorietà, quali, solo per citarne alcuni, l’anatomista Bartolomeo Panizza, Luigi Porta, il fisiologo Eusebio Oehl, Paolo Mantegazza, Giulio Bizzozero, il botanico Santo Garovaglio, il matematico Francesco Brioschi, il fisico Giovanni Cantoni, il geologo Torquato Taramelli, il filosofo Carlo Cantoni, lo storico Giacinto Romano e fu il primo ateneo italiano a ricevere il Premio Nobel nella persona del medico e istologo Camillo Golgi. Nel 1883 con l\'annessione del comune dei Corpi Santi, la superficie del comune s\'ingrandì, negli stessi anni cominciarono a sorgere importanti industrie, come la Necchi, mentre nel 1905 sorse la Snia Viscosa, prima grande fabbrica italiana di seta artificiale e tessuti sintetici, seguite da molte altre, tanto che nei primi decenni del Novecento gli addetti all\'industria in città erano 16.000[76]. Nel 1895 le famiglie di Jakob e Hermann Einstein, lo zio e il padre del sedicenne Albert Einstein, si trasferirono a Pavia, dove dal 1894 avevano fondato officine elettrotecniche Nazionali Einstein-Garrone lungo il Naviglio Pavese[77].\n\nLe ex Officine Elettrotecniche Einstein- Garrone, fondate nel 1894 a da Hermann Einstein, padre di Albert Einstein.\nNelle elezioni dell’autunno del 1920 il Partito Socialista raggiunse uno straordinario risultato elettorale ottenendo in provincia ben 156 sindaci su 220 e 56 seggi su 60 del consiglio provinciale, da subito si scatenò quindi la reazione fascista e i sindaci socialisti vennero cacciati uno dopo l’altro con la violenza[78].\nLa presa di Pavia da parte dei fascisti maturò proprio nei giorni cruciali della marcia su Roma e venne coordinata da Angelo Nicolato[79]. Egli stabilì il proprio quartier generale nella locanda Tre Re di Cava Manara, dove furono fatte convergere le forze fasciste. L’operazione ebbe inizio la mattina del 28 ottobre 1922, quando le squadre fasciste entrarono a Pavia e si diressero verso la prefettura, senza incontrare nessuna resistenza da parte del presidio militare della città e in poche ore presero il controllo dei punti nevralgici di Pavia. Le camicie nere fecero poi irruzione nella sede comunale, palazzo Mezzabarba. Il sindaco socialista, Alcide Malagugini, convocò il consiglio comunale che il 29 ottobre venne sciolto[80]. La carica di sindaco venne assunta dal dirigente fascista Cesare Forni, espressione dell\'ala più dura del partito, legata ai grandi proprietari agrari[81].\nIn città rimasero comunque attivi alcuni antifascisti, come Giorgio Errera, docente di Chimica presso l’università. Egli, nel 1923, rifiutò la carica di rettore, che gli era stata proposta dal ministro Giovanni Gentile, di cui era amico, e nel 1931 fu uno dei dodici professori universitari italiani (su 1.255) che rifiutò di giurare fedeltà al fascismo e fu per questo messo in pensione[82][83].\nDopo l’8 settembre del 1943, Pavia venne occupata dall’esercito tedesco. Nel settembre del 1944 le forze aeree statunitensi effettuarono diversi bombardamenti sulla città con l’obiettivo di distruggere i tre ponti sul Ticino, strategici per rifornire di uomini, armi e vettovaglie le unità tedesche impegnate lungo la linea Gotica. Tali operazioni portarono alla distruzione del ponte Coperto e provocarono la morte di 119 civili[84][85].\nLa battaglia per la liberazione di Pavia si svolse nella notte tra il 25 e il 26 aprile del 1945, giorno in cui, dopo che la guarnigione tedesca aveva abbandonato la città, le rimanenti forze fasciste si arresero ai partigiani. Il 27 aprile il Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale prese possesso della prefettura e il 30 aprile entrarono le prime truppe alleate in città[78].\n\nIl 7 aprile del 1946 si sono tenute le prime elezioni comunali dopo la dittatura. Il partito più votato fu la Democrazia Cristiana che ottenne il 32,8% dei voti. Il primo sindaco eletto fu il socialista Cornelio Fietta. Al referendum istituzionale del 2 giugno del 1946 Pavia assegnò il 67,1% dei voti alla Repubblica, mentre la monarchia ottenne solo il 38,2%[86].Urna usata per le votazioni comunali (XVIII secolo) e campanella e sigillo del comune (XVI secolo), tutti riportano la raffigurazione del Regisole, Pavia, Musei Civici.\nSimboli[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nStendardo della contea di Pavia ai tempi Massimiliano Sforza (1512- 1515)\n\n\nIl gonfalone\nI simboli di Pavia sono lo stemma, il gonfalone e il sigillo, così come riportato nello Statuto comunale all\'art. 7:\n\n\n\n«Viene assunto quale stemma comunale il simbolo storico: croce bianca in campo rosso.\nIl Comune fa uso nelle cerimonie ufficiali del gonfalone.\nIl sigillo del Comune ha il Regisole.»\n\n(Art. 7 dello Statuto comunale[87])\nLo stemma e il sigillo sono stati riconosciuti con D.C.G. del 12 marzo 1943.[88]\nIl gonfalone utilizzato dalla moderna città di Pavia riprende fedelmente quello usato dal comune di Pavia almeno dal XIII secolo: un vessillo rosso con una croce di San Giovanni Battista di colore bianco. Tale simbolo, probabilmente derivato dalla blutfahne, l\'originaria bandiera del sovrano del Sacro Romano Impero, aveva un chiaro significato politico: rimarcare l’appartenenza di Pavia alla fazione ghibellina. Anche lo stemma del comune raffigura la croce di San Giovanni Battista che, a partire dalla fine del XVI secolo, ha cominciato a essere rappresentata in forma ovale e all’interno di una ricca cornice, in cima alla quale si trova un mascherone dotato di corona comitale e spesso affiancato da due angeli che reggono lo scudo e dalle lettere CO-PP (Comunitas Papie[89]).\nNel 1396 l\'imperatore Venceslao concesse a Gian Galeazzo un diploma con il quale venne regolato il sistema successorio al trono del ducato di Milano basandolo sulla primogenitura maschile e Pavia fu elevata a contea. Da quella data all\'erede al trono ducale fu conferito il titolo di Conte di Pavia[90] (innalzato poi dall\'imperatore Massimiliano nel 1499 a quello di principe[91]). Da allora, l’originario stemma comunale cominciò a essere affiancato da quello della contea, che era bipartito con al lato sinistro il biscione visconteo in un campo bianco, mentre in quello sinistro campeggiavano tre aquile nere in campo giallo[89].\nIl sigillo del comune raffigura il Regisole, un\'antica statua equestre tardoantica in bronzo originariamente collocata all\'interno del Palazzo Reale e, verosimilmente nell\'XI secolo, posta nella piazza del duomo. La statua fu abbattuta dai giacobini nel 1796.\n\nOnorificenze[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa città di Pavia è la ventitreesima tra le 27 Città decorate con medaglia d\'oro come \"benemerite del Risorgimento nazionale\" per le azioni altamente patriottiche compiute dalla città nel periodo del Risorgimento, periodo, definito dalla Casa Savoia, compreso tra i moti insurrezionali del 1848 e la fine della prima guerra mondiale nel 1918.\n\n\n\n\nMedaglia d\'oro alle Città Benemerite del Risorgimento Nazionale\n«In ricompensa delle benemerenze patriottiche acquistate durante il periodo del risorgimento nazionale.

Gran parte del patrimonio artistico-architettonico di Pavia si trova nel centro storico, che mantiene, dal punto di vista urbanistico, l’impianto ortogonale impostato nel I a.C. quando la città fu fondata, in parte ripreso anche nelle aree del centro sviluppatesi nel medioevo al di fuori della cerchia muraria di età classica.\nArchitetture religiose[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Monasteri di Pavia.\n\nLa basilica di San Michele Maggiore\nBasilica di San Michele Maggiore[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nBasilica di San Michele Maggiore, è il più famoso e importante monumento religioso medievale della città. Capolavoro dello stile romanico lombardo, la chiesa raccoglie numerose testimonianze del periodo in cui Pavia era la capitale del regno italico. Una prima chiesa di San Michele fu costruita originariamente nel periodo longobardo (a questo periodo risale la parte inferiore del campanile), ma fu distrutta da un incendio nel 1004; la costruzione attuale ebbe inizio alla fine dell\'XI secolo[93] (a cui risalgono la cripta, il coro e i transetti), probabilmente a seguito del terremoto del 1117[94], e venne probabilmente completata intorno al 1130[93]. La basilica di San Michele è considerata il prototipo delle numerose chiese medievali pavesi: tuttavia si discosta dalle altre chiese cittadine per l\'utilizzo estensivo, sia per la struttura sia per le decorazioni, della fragile pietra arenaria in luogo del cotto, e anche per la particolare e complessa conformazione architettonica, che prevede una pianta a croce latina a tre navate con matronei e un transetto particolarmente sviluppato, dotato di una propria autonoma facciata sul lato settentrionale. La basilica fu sede di numerosi eventi importanti, tra cui le incoronazioni di Berengario I (888), Guido II (889), Ludovico III (900), Rodolfo II (922), Ugo (926), Berengario II e suo figlio Adalberto II (950), Arduino (1002), Enrico II (1004) e Federico Barbarossa (1155).\n\nDuomo di Pavia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl Duomo di Pavia\nL\'attuale statua del Regisole davanti al Duomo di Pavia. In fondo a sinistra, le rovine della Torre civica crollata nel 1989Duomo di Pavia, dedicato a Santa Maria Assunta e a Santo Stefano (protomartire), è un\'imponente costruzione con pianta a croce greca[95]. Il cantiere per la cattedrale fu aperto (con la demolizione delle due originarie basiliche dell\'XI e XII secolo) nel 1488 su ordine del vescovo Ascanio Maria Sforza Visconti: la struttura rimase per secoli incompleta, fino alla fine del XIX secolo, quando furono completate la cupola e la facciata, rispettivamente nel 1885 e nel 1898, secondo il progetto originale di Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. La cupola centrale, il cui disegno è attribuito al Bramante, a pianta ottagonale, con un\'altezza di 97 metri, una luce di 34 e un peso nell\'ordine delle 20.000 tonnellate, è la quarta in Italia per dimensioni. Dopo quasi 17 anni di lavori di restauro e messa in sicurezza della cupola, nel 2013 la chiesa è stata riaperta ai fedeli. A fianco del Duomo era situata la Torre civica, di cui si ha menzione fin dal 1330 e che era stata ulteriormente innalzata nel 1583 da Pellegrino Tibaldi. La torre crollò improvvisamente la mattina del 17 marzo 1989 per cause sconosciute, provocando quattro vittime e 15 feriti, e da allora non è stata più ricostruita.\nBasilica di San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nBasilica di San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro, le cui origini sono da ricercarsi all\'inizio dell\'VIII secolo, fu, secondo la tradizione, fondata da re Liutprando[96]. Ricostruita a partire dall\'XI secolo, la costruzione moderna è stata consacrata nel 1132[97]. La facciata, la cupola e il pavimento a mosaico sono simili a San Michele Maggiore, senza però le caratteristiche sculture. San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro, che insieme con San Michele è la più spaziosa tra le basiliche romaniche pavesi, si distingue comunque dall\'altra costruzione per l\'uso intensivo del cotto in luogo dell\'arenaria, per la facciata visibilmente asimmetrica dotata di un solo portale, e internamente per l\'assenza dei matronei e per il transetto più corto, non sporgente dalla pianta rettangolare del tempio. L\'esterno è decorato con bacini ceramici islamici.\n\nLa facciata di San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro\nGiovanni di Balduccio, arca di Sant\'AgostinoAll\'interno, murata nell\'ultimo pilastro della navata destra, si trova la tomba del re longobardo Liutprando (m. 744), le cui ossa furono ritrovate nel 1896. Nella chiesa sono anche conservate le reliquie di Sant\'Agostino, portate qui da Liutprando dalla Sardegna. Le reliquie del Santo sono conservate nella famosa Arca di sant\'Agostino, la cui mole marmorea è visibile sull\'altar maggiore. L\'Arca fu realizzata da Giovanni di Balduccio tra 1362 e il 1365 ed è ornata da almeno 150 tra statue e bassorilievi. La chiesa è nominata anche da Dante Alighieri, che, nel X canto del Paradiso, vv.127-129 (nella Divina Commedia), riporta questi versi: Lo corpo ond\'ella fu cacciata giace / giuso in Ciel d\'Auro, ed essa da martiro / e da essilio venne in questa pace; ci si riferisce all\'anima di Severino Boezio, un Romano consigliere del re ostrogoto Teodorico, fatto da questi giustiziare sotto l\'accusa di tradimento. Il corpo di Boezio è anch\'esso conservato infatti nella Basilica, precisamente nella cripta.\nChiesa di Santa Maria del Carmine[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa chiesa di Santa Maria del Carmine\nChiesa di Santa Maria del Carmine, è uno dei più noti esempi di architettura gotica a mattoni nel nord Italia. La costruzione del grandioso edificio incominciò nel 1374[94] su progetto attribuito a Bernardo da Venezia, per giungere a compimento, con la facciata, nel 1461. È, dopo la Cattedrale, la più vasta chiesa della città, con un perimetro rettangolare di metri 80 x 40, entro il quale trova posto una ardita struttura a croce latina a tre navate affiancate da cappelle. La facciata è caratteristica per il grande rosone e le sette guglie. L\'elegante campanile, alto oltre settanta metri, è considerato il maggiore e il più bello della città. Venne restaurata fra il 2006 e il 2010.\n\nChiesa di San Gervasio e ProtasioLa chiesa dei Santi Gervasio e ProtasioChiesa dei Santi Gervasio e Protasio, secondo il cronista Opicino De Canistris, questa è la più antica chiesa della città, fondata in epoca romana attorno al IV secolo[98], e ospitò per più di seicento anni il corpo di San Siro, fondatore della prima comunità cristiana pavese e della chiesa, vissuto nella prima metà del IV secolo d.C. Fu intitolata ai santi Gervasio e Protasio, martiri del III secolo, per la custodia delle loro reliquie, scoperte a Milano da Sant\'Ambrogio nel 386 e portate a Pavia da sant’Invenzio, che fu il terzo vescovo di Pavia dopo San Siro e San Pompeo. In questa chiesa oltre ai santi vescovi Siro e Pompeo fu sepolto il re longobardo Clefi nel 574 e, successivamente, il figlio, re Autari; fu gestita dai chierici dei monaci di San Colombano di Bobbio. Nel corso degli anni è testimoniata la presenza di monaci benedettini a partire dal XII secolo, e di un ospizio per pellegrini, istituito nel 1366 e rifabbricato verso la fine del XVI secolo, quando viene affidato al Terz\'Ordine Francescano. Furono sempre i Francescani, tra il 1712 e il 1718, a riedificare la chiesa come la vediamo adesso, invertendone l\'orientamento. In seguito a questa trasformazione sono state demolite la facciata romanica, sostituita dall\'attuale abside, e l\'abside originaria, sostituita dalla nuova facciata in stile classico. Nel 2004 è stato rinvenuto, nella cappella di San Siro, un ciclo di affreschi del XVI secolo, di cui nel 2009 si è completato il restauro, che permette di qualificarlo come il ritrovamento storico-artistico più importante del secolo a Pavia.\nChiesa di San Teodoro[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nFacciata della chiesa di San Teodoro\nChiesa di San Teodoro, è una chiesa di impianto tardo romanico situata nel centro storico di Pavia. Risalente al XII secolo[94], l\'aspetto originario è stato ripristinato con i restauri effettuati a cavallo del \'900. Ospita cicli di affreschi rappresentanti le Storie di Sant\'Agnese e San Teodoro e due importanti affreschi attribuiti a Bernardino Lanzani con vedute di Pavia del XVI secolo.\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria di Canepanova[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nChiesa di Santa Maria di Canepanova, opera rinascimentale, che secondo un\'antica tradizione fu progettata dal Bramante, e sicuramente edificata dall\'Amadeo dal 1500 al 1507[99]. La chiesa è stata costruita per celebrare un affresco quattrocentesco ritenuto miracoloso dalla tradizione[100], raffigurante la Madonna del Latte che si trovava sulla facciata di una casa di Viscardo della famiglia nobile dei Canepanova, i quali sovvenzionarono in parte i lavori, dando anche il nome alla chiesa stessa. A pianta quadrata, la decorazione interna fu realizzata all\'inizio del Seicento da vari pittori di scuola barocca.\n\nFacciata della chiesa di San Francesco\nAltre chiese[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nChiesa di San Francesco, duecentesca[94], ha una facciata degna di nota, peculiare per la presenza del portale centrale sdoppiato. La chiesa, molto grande, presenta un impianto a croce latina, con copertura a capriate lignee nella navata centrale e a volta nel capocroce. Anche se relativamente meno nota rispetto agli edifici di culto sopra descritti, San Francesco è, in termini di dimensioni, la terza chiesa della città dopo il Duomo e Santa Maria del Carmine.\nChiesa di San Giovanni Domnarum, fondata dalla regina Gundeperga nel 654[101], si trova in pieno centro storico, inglobata in un cortile di abitazioni civili, ospita una cripta altomedievale scoperta nel 1914[102].\n\nChiesa di San Giorgio in Montefalcone di periodo medioevale (forse fondata in età longobarda[103]) in pieno centro storico sorge su una specie di fortilizio da cui probabilmente all\'epoca si dominava il corso del Ticino. Attaccato alla chiesa vi è un ossario a vista.\nChiesa dei Santi Primo e Feliciano, la parte esterna ha forme romaniche come la facciata in mattone restaurata nel 1940[104]. Nel secolo XVI l\'interno della chiesa fu ridotto a una sola navata e completamente riadattato in stile barocco.\nChiesa di Santa Maria in Betlem, fu costruita nel 1130[94] nel sito in cui già sorgeva un oratorio di età carolingia di cui, sotto il pavimento della chiesa attuale, si conservano i resti. La chiesa, presso la quale si trovava un ospedale che forniva assistenza e cura ai pellegrini diretti in Terra Santa e ai malati, era dipendente dal vescovo di Betlemme e presenta forme romaniche.\nChiesa di Santa Maria Teodote. La chiesa fu parte del monastero di Santa Maria Teodote, detto anche di Santa Maria della Pusterla, che fu uno dei più antichi e importanti monasteri femminili di Pavia. Fondato tra il 679 e il 700 da re Cuniperto, fu soppresso nel 1799 e dal 1868 ospita il seminario diocesano[105].\nCappella di San Salvatore, nel lato orientale del chiostro rinascimentale del monastero di Santa Maria Teodote (Attuale seminario della diocesi di Pavia) si trova la piccola cappella a pianta centrale edificata nell\'ultimo ventennio del Quattrocento e riccamente affrescata da Bernardino Lanzani tra il 1506 e il 1507.Chiesa di San Lazzaro\nChiesa di San Luca, oratorio della Confraternita dei Disciplini, venne consacrata il 21 dicembre 1609. È situata nella parte orientale del centro della città, lungo l\'importante direttrice viaria per Piacenza e Cremona. La facciata è posta a nord lungo l\'attuale Corso Garibaldi ad attestare l’importanza della strada[106].\nChiesa di Sant\'Eusebio, aveva come cripta una costruzione del VII secolo[94], ancora conservata e visitabile in piazza Leonardo da Vinci, rarissimo esempio di architettura longobarda.\nChiesa di San Lazzaro, fondata nel 1157 da Gislenzone Salimbene, e dai figli Siro e Malastreva, unitamente all\'omonimo ospedale, l\'attuale edificio fu realizzato in forme romaniche nella prima metà del Duecento[94]. La facciata è arricchita da bacini ceramici di origine bizantina, mentre alcuni capitelli risalgono all\'età Carolingia. L\'interno, restaurato negli anni\'30, conserva vaste tracce di affreschi del XIII secolo. La chiesa e l\'annesso ospedale, nel XVI secolo passarono sotto il controllo dell\'Ordine dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro, sotto il quale rimase fino alla metà dell\'Ottocento[107].\nLa chiesa di Santa Maria in Betlem\nMonastero e chiesa di San Pietro in Verzolo, sorto (forse su un precedente edificio di età longobarda) nel X secolo come monastero benedettino. Nel 1486 ai benedettini subentrarono i cistercensi di Chiaravalle, fino al 1798, quando il monastero venne soppresso, mentre la chiesa, come parrocchia, sopravvisse. Gran parte della struttura della chiesa e degli edifici annessi, come il piccolo chiostro, sono strutturati su murature dell\'XI secolo, realizzate con molti laterizi romani di recupero e ciottoli fluviali, come pure di recupero pare essere uno dei capitelli, di età longobarda, inserito nella romaniche bifore del chiostro. La facciata fu rifatta nella seconda metà del Cinquecento, mentre l\'interno della chiesa fu modificato nella prima metà del Settecento[108].\nBasilica del Santissimo Salvatore\nMonastero e chiesa di San Salvatore, le cui origini risalgono al VII secolo[109], fu infatti fondata da re Ariperto I nel 657 e venne ricostruita dall\'Amadeo nel XV-XVI secolo[110]\nChiesa di San Lanfranco, risalente al XII secolo[94], contiene la tomba del vescovo Lanfranco Beccari (m. 1189), realizzata nel 1498 dallo scultore e architetto Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (1447-1552), nato a Pavia. All\'interno della chiesa vi è un affresco, tra i più antichi della città (XIII secolo), scoperto nel 1930 sotto l\'intonaco, raffigurante l\'assassinio di Tommaso Becket. La scena ritrae il vescovo che indossa la casula mentre viene colpito da cinque sicari.\nChiesa di Santa Maria delle Grazie, seicentesca[111], ha la dignità di basilica minore\nChiesa di Santa Maria in Corte Cremona, Il nome della chiesa (documentata almeno dal 1232) deriva dal fatto che nelle sue vicinanze sorgeva il palazzo (corte) dove il vescovo di Cremona alloggiava quando, nell’alto medioevo, giungeva a Pavia (allora capitale del regno d\'Italia) in occasione di placiti, incoronazioni e alti eventi che si svolgevano in città[112].\nChiesa di Santa Maria di Caravaggio. Situata nella periferia ovest della città, la chiesa sorse, su progetto di Giovanni Muzio, nel 1956.\nChiese inglobate in edifici residenziali o adattate ad altri usi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nNella seconda metà del XVIII nella città e nelle sue aree suburbane si trovavano oltre 140 chiese e cappelle, un numero spropositata per un centro delle dimensioni di Pavia. Tale fenomeno era principalmente dovuto al ruolo di capitale ricoperto dalla città dall’età longobarda fino al 1024, infatti, solo tra il 569 e il 774 furono fondati almeno 21 chiese e monasteri (ma il numero potrebbe essere più elevato, dato che anche altri edifici religiosi urbani tradizionalmente vengono, pur in assenza prove documentarie o archeologiche, ritenuti di età longobarda), gran parte di essi furono istituiti da sovrani e dalle maggiori aristocrazie del regno, soprattutto con lo scopo di trasformarle in mausolei[113]. A partire dal regno di Giuseppe II (come nel resto della Lombardia Austriaca) e fino a tutta l’età napoleonica, gran parte di tali chiese ed enti religiosi vennero soppresse e i loro edifici furono destinato a uso pubblico (principalmente caserme, università, collegi e scuole) o ceduti a privati, che molto spesso li fecero demolire per sostituirli con abitazioni civili.\n\nChiesa di San Colombano MaggioreChiesa di San Colombano maggiore. La chiesa di origine longobarda, dotata di xenodochio per i pellegrini, gestita dai monaci di San Colombano di Bobbio, è attestata da documenti fin dal IX secolo[114][115]; tra le fonti edite di carattere generale, la parrocchia è citata nel 1250 nei documenti concernenti l\'estimo pavese del secolo XIII; è elencata tra le parrocchie di Porta Palacensis nelle Rationes decimarum del 1322-1323; compare nei rogiti del cancelliere episcopale Albertolo Griffi degli anni 1370-1420; è ancora menzionata negli atti della visita pastorale compiuta nel 1460 da Amicus de Fossulanis. La parrocchia di San Colombano fu soppressa nel 1565 e unita alla parrocchia dei Santi Giacomo e Filippo concentrando i redditi e i diritti. Convertita a uso magazzino, conserva gran parte della sua ossatura, con la navata centrale e quella di sinistra divise da pilastri. La facciata è in gran parte integra, e rivela elementi nuovi rispetto alla precedente serie delle basiliche romaniche pavesi. Nel 1963 sono stati distrutti gli avanzi del presbiterio e dell\'abside centrale, mentre la navata destra è mancante da tempo.\nChiesa di San Felice. Il monastero benedettino femminile di San Felice fu fondato nel 760 da re Desiderio[116] e dotato, nei secoli seguenti, da re e imperatori di grandi possessioni terriere. Soppresso nel 1785, divenne un orfanotrofio. Attualmente è sede del Dipartimento di Scienze Economiche e Aziendali. Conserva l\'antica chiesa, le cui strutture risalgono alla metà dell\'VIII secolo, all\'interno della quale vi è la cripta di età longobarda e alcune tombe datate tra l\'VIII e il IX secolo[94]. Il chiostro fu rifatto tra la fine del XV secolo e i primi anni del Cinquecento.\nChiesa di San Marino. La chiesa, con annesso monastero benedettino, di San Marino fu fondata nell\'VIII secolo dal re longobardo Astolfo, che fu seppellito al suo interno. La struttura subì rimaneggiamenti nel XII secolo[117] e poi, più consistenti, tra Cinque e Seicento. Al suo interno si conserva una pala del Giampietrino.\nChiesa di Santa Maria delle Cacce. Fondata nel VIII secolo, forse da re Rachis o Desiderio, fu un monastero Benedettino Femminile, poi soppresso nel 1799. L\'edificio monastico fu ricostruito nel Cinquecento e attualmente è adibito a edificio scolastico, mentre la chiesa fu rifatta nel XVII secolo, pur conservando elementi, come la cripta, del primitivo edificio di età longobarda\nChiesa dei Santi Giacomo e Filippo, Francesco Maria Richino, 1626.\nChiesa di San Maiolo. ll monastero di San Maiolo fu fondato nell\'anno 967 dal giudice Gaidolfo, che lo donò all’abate di Cluny San Maiolo. Ben presto il monastero divenne il principale centro di diffusione della riforma cluniacense nel Nord Italia. Nel XIII secolo iniziò la decadenza del monastero, che divenne commenda nel 1380 e fu infine soppresso nel 1564 e affidato alla Congregazione Somasca. Nel 1596 la chiesa medievale fu ricostruita in forme manieriste. Nel 1790 la casa venne soppressa e passò nelle mani di privati. Acquistato dalla Stato Italiano negli anni ’60, ospita ora l’Archivio di Stato di Pavia. Degno di nota è il chiostro quattrocentesco, che conserva tracce della chiesa romanica[118].\nFacciata della Chiesa di San TommasoChiesa di San Tommaso. Il monastero benedettino femminile di San Tommaso è menzionato per la prima volta in un diploma imperiale di Arnolfo del 889. La chiesa fu ricostruita nel 1213 e nel 1302 divenne sede dei frati Domenicani. A partire dal 1320 iniziarono i lavori per la costruzione della nuova, e più grande, chiesa, tuttavia, a causa delle numerose interruzioni, il cantiere fu ultimato solo nel 1478. Nel 1786 il monastero venne soppresso da Giuseppe II e trasformato nel Seminario Generale per la Lombardia Austriaca. Giuseppe Piermarini, incaricato di adattare il complesso alla nuova destinazione, modificò pesantemente la chiesa. Pochi anni dopo, nel 1791, il seminario venne chiuso e il complesso divenne una caserma, e tale rimase fino agli anni ’80 del Novecento, quando fu ceduto all’Università degli Studi di Pavia.\nChiesa di San Pietro in Vincoli. Si trova in un vicolo del centro storico (Via Cravos) da cui si vedono le forme della facciata. Fu edificata sopra le rovine di un tempio pagano e la chiesa originaria risale all\'epoca longobarda.

Nel primo trentennio dei VI secolo il re Teodorico promosse la costruzione di un palazzo regio nella città. A partire dal 540 Pavia diventò la sede del Tesoro regio e della corte, e qui furono eletti i re Erarico, Totila e Teia. Pavia divenne definitiva capitale del regno Longobardo nella prima metà del VII secolo e il vecchio palazzo Regio di età gota fu allargato. Il palazzo reale era formato da un complesso di edifici dove trovavano sede, oltre alla corte e all\'abitazione del sovrano, anche la cancelleria, la zecca e il massimo tribunale del regno.Vi erano poi diverse cappelle, un carcere, spazi dedicati agli scambi commerciali, diversi cortili dove si svolgevano i placiti e un grande giardino, popolato da animali esotici. Vicino al palazzo si trovava una porta urbica detta Porta Palacense. Con la caduta del regno Longobardo, il palazzo e le sue strutture, furono utilizzate dai sovrani carolingi e ottonidi che si susseguirono al potere, dato che Pavia mantenne il ruolo di capitale del Regno d\'Italia. Nel 1024, dopo la morte di Enrico II il Santo, il palazzo fu demolito dai cittadini di Pavia[134].\n\nInterno del Teatro Fraschini\nPonte Coperto[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Ponte Coperto di Pavia.\n\nIl Collegio Ghislieri\nIl centro storico cittadino è situato sulla riva sinistra del Ticino, mentre sulla riva destra si trova Borgo Ticino, quartiere che era originariamente fuori dalle mura della città. Il centro storico e Borgo Ticino erano collegati dal Ponte Coperto (detto anche Ponte Vecchio), datato 1351-1354, che fu danneggiato durante la seconda guerra mondiale dai bombardamenti alleati e abbattuto nel dopoguerra per la scarsa sensibilità del tempo verso i monumenti storici[135]. Una copia del ponte antico, non del tutto fedele all\'originale (è di dimensioni maggiori e si trova 30 metri più a valle), è stata costruita nel dopoguerra.\n\nPalazzi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Ville e palazzi di Pavia.\n\nPalazzo Mezzabarba, sede del municipio\nFacciata del Collegio Borromeo\nCasa degli Eustacchi\nPiazza Ghislieri\nNumerosi edifici storici, abitazioni di antiche potenti famiglie cittadine, sono tuttora presenti nel centro cittadino. Pasino Eustachi fu capitano della flotta viscontea ai tempi di Gian Galeazzo, e suoi eredi servirono i successivi duchi, presso il Ticino si conserva la loro casa dei primissimi anni del XV secolo. Tra questi sono da ricordare la Reggia di re Alboino, in via Alboino[136], il Palazzo Malaspina, il Palazzo Carminali Bottigella in corso Cavour, il Palazzo Cornazzani (dove abitarono Ugo Foscolo, Albert Einstein, Contardo Ferrini e Ada Negri), la Casa Belcredi, il Palazzo Cavagna, il Palazzo Bottigella in corso Mazzini (entrambi attribuiti all\'Amadeo), la Casa Folperti, la Casa Beccaria, il Palazzo Arnaboldi Gazzaniga, il Palazzo Bellisomi Vistarino, il Palazzo Brambilla, il Palazzo Orlandi in piazza del Carmine e il Palazzo Mezzabarba, oggi sede del municipio di Pavia, il Palazzo Olevano e il Palazzo Del Maino.

Per opera di papa Pio V, al secolo Antonio Ghislieri, nel 1567, sorse il Collegio Ghislieri, mentre già dal 1429 era attivo il Collegio Castiglioni, fondato dal cardinale Branda Castiglioni.\n\nLa Casa dei Diversi (detta anche Casa Rossa), Pavia, piazza della Vittoria\nIn piazza della Vittoria spicca la Casa dei Diversi (detta anche Casa Rossa), costruita tra il 1376 e il 1383 da Nicolino de Diversi, maestro delle Entrate di Gian Galeazzo Visconti[138].\n\nBroletto[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Broletto (Pavia).\n\nIl cortile interno del broletto di Pavia\nIl Broletto di Pavia, che si affaccia su Piazza della Vittoria, sorse nel XII secolo come sede dell\'autorità comunale (destinazione che mantenne fino al 1875) e fu più volte rimaneggiato nei secoli successivi[139].\n\nArchitetture militari[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLe mura\n\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Mura di Pavia.\n\nIl Collegio Castiglioni-Brugnatelli (1429).\nLa prima cinta muraria di Pavia, di cui non rimangono tracce visibili, fu realizzata in età romana. Le mura vennero ampliate, con l\'inclusione di alcuni borghi extraurbani, intorno al X secolo, mentre una nuova, più grande, cinta fu realizzata alla fine del XII secolo[140]. Esternamente alle mura della città, tra XII e XIII sorsero alcuni borghi extraurbani, come Borgoratto, Borgo di Sant\'Apollinare, Borgo di San Guglielmo o Borgo di San Pietro in Verzolo, i quali tuttavia non furono dotati di opere difensive[141]. Durante la dominazione spagnola, la cinta fu ulteriormente ingrandita (1557-1560) con l\'aggiunta di dodici bastioni e le mura sopravvissero fino alla seconda metà dell\'Ottocento[142]. Di queste mura rimangono alcuni tratti verso il Ticino, in viale Gorizia e nel Castello sul lato nord. Rafforzate da ulteriori opere nel primo Settecento, dopo la fine della guerre dei sette anni, le fortificazioni della città caddero in decadenza, tanto che, con la Sovrana Determinazione del 1783, l\'imperatore Giuseppe II cancellò Pavia dal novero delle fortezze dell\'Impero e le fortificazioni furono riconvertite a uso civile[143].\nPorte di Pavia\n\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Porte di Pavia.\n\nLe prime porte cittadine di Pavia vennero realizzate in epoca romana repubblicana contestualmente alle mura cittadine[144]. Le nuove mura, sorte nel X secolo, erano provviste di nove porte, protette ai lati da due grosse torri aggettanti mentre altre torri fronteggiavano gli ingressi verso l\'esterno[145]. Insieme alle porte, la città era messa in comunicazione con l’esterno tramite alcune pusterle (uscite secondarie). Una nuova terza cerchia di mura più grande, sostanzialmente ricalcata dal tracciato dai bastioni spagnoli, fu realizzata nel corso del XII secolo, molto probabilmente prima del 1198, dato che in quell\'anno un\'iscrizione ora nei Musei Civici menziona, oltre alla creazione del Broletto, anche la costruzione delle fortificazioni. Le porte principali di Pavia erano nove e davano origine ai rispettivi quartieri nei quali la città era divisa, come evidenziato dagli estimi del 1250.\nTra il XV e il XVI secolo, lo sviluppo delle artiglierie resero ben presto superate le fortificazioni della terza cerchia muraria, tanto che nei primi decenni del Cinquecento, durante i numerosi assedi che subì la città, esse furono rafforzate con bastioni e opere in terra e legno. Solo tra il 1546 e il 1569, per ordine di Ferrante Gonzaga (governatore del ducato di Milano), Pavia fu dotata di una nuova cerchia muraria bastionata progettata da Giovanni Maria Olgiati[142]. Lungo le mura spagnole si aprivano otto porte. Delle antiche Porte attualmente si conservano:\n\nPorta Calcinara\nPorta Nuova\nPorta Milano o Porta San Vito\nLe torri[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Torri di Pavia.\n\nAlcune delle torri medievali ancora presenti in città. Pavia, via Luigi Porta.\nAlcune delle torri di Pavia\nPavia una volta era detta \"la città delle cento torri\", perché in passato moltissime erano le torri presenti in città, come si può osservare dalla veduta di Pavia presente nella chiesa di San Teodoro. Di tutte queste torri se ne conservano circa sessanta per lo più ribassate e integrate negli edifici adiacenti, mentre solo 6 sono quelle ancora integre. Le prime torri furono realizzate intorno al XII secolo[94], quando Pavia era un potente comune, per opera delle più importanti consorterie urbane, infatti le torri sorgevano accanto ai palazzi delle varie famiglie. In origine erano molto alte e a pianta quadrata, come le due torri dell\'Università o quella \"del Maino\", alte, rispettivamente, 40 e 50 metri[146].\n\nCastello Visconteo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Castello Visconteo (Pavia).\n\nVeduta laterale del castello Visconteo\nA Pavia si trova il castello Visconteo[147], costruito nel 1360[148] per ordine di Galeazzo II Visconti forse su progetto di Bernardo da Venezia, fu sede della corte di Galeazzo II, Gian Galeazzo e, fino al 1413, di Filippo Maria, era collegato, tramite un vasto parco (il parco Visconteo) difeso da mura e torri, con la Certosa Il castello è sede dei Musei Civici comunali e della Pinacoteca Malaspina.\n\nCastello di Mirabello[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Castello di Mirabello.\n\nVeduta posteriore del castello Visconteo\nIn località Mirabello sorge il castello trecentesco di Mirabello[149]. Il castello fu realizzato, sulle rovine di una torre del tardo XIII secolo, dalla famiglia pavese dei Fiamberti tra il 1325 e il 1341; dopo il 1360 esso divenne proprietà dei Visconti, che lo ricostruirono. Il castello era inserito nel grande parco Visconteo, che si estendeva dal castello Visconteo fino alla Certosa, ed era la sede del capitano del parco.\n\nVie e piazze[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Strade e piazze di Pavia.\n\nL\'ampia piazza centrale della città, piazza della Vittoria, anticamente piazza Grande, ha una forma stretta e lunga ed è divisa in due aree dalla strada. Nei sotterranei della piazza si estende un grande mercato coperto sotterraneo, costruito nel 1958 e successivamente ampliato e ammodernato. Un altro mercato coperto, ma non sotterraneo, si trova poco lontano: si tratta del mercato di piazza Arnaboldi, ospitato in un cortile aperto al pubblico e coperto da una cupola in ferro e vetro del 1882, la Cupola Arnaboldi.\n\nAltro[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl Regisole[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Regisole.\n\nEra una statuta equestre bronzea di età tardoantica o altomedievale, forse raffigurava Teodorico a cavallo e, verosimilmente, proveniva dal Palazzo Reale. La statua fu demolita dai giacobini nel 1796[150] e ricostruita dallo scultore Francesco Messina negli anni \'30 del Novecento. Si trova in Piazza del Duomo.\n\nStatua della Minerva[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nRealizzata nel 1938 dallo scultore Francesco Messina, la gigantesca statua di marmo e di bronzo della Minerva accoglie i visitatori ed è un simbolo della città. La Minerva, secondo la mitologia greca, era la Dea della speranza, della saggezza e della guerra[151]. Si trova nell\'omonima piazza, nei pressi di dove sorgeva l\'antica Porta Cavour.\n\nStatua di Giuseppe Garibaldi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nRealizzata nel 1882, l\'opera consiste in uno scoglio raffigurante l\'isola di Caprera, soggiorno prediletto di Garibaldi, sopra il quale s\'innalza la statua in bronzo dell\'eroe con la barba e lo sguardo fiero, vestito con la camicia rossa e con le mani riposanti sull\'elsa della sciabola, a significare che la stessa ormai non uscirà più dal fodero. La roccia, che serve da piedistallo, è adorna di varie allegorie: la Vittoria che spezza le catene della schiavitù, il Leone che rappresenta la forza del popolo, i trofei guerreschi ed altre[152]. Si trova nel Giardino dei Bersaglieri, di fronte al Castello Visconteo.\n\nStatua di Papa Pio V Ghislieri[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Statua di papa Pio V Ghislieri.\n\nColossale statua in bronzo in stile barocco di Pio V eseguita nel 1692 da Francesco Nuvolone, dopo la sua beatificazione, si trova di fronte al Collegio Ghislieri[153].\n\nStatua della Lavandaia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nRealizzata nel 1981, si trova lungo la caratteristica Via Milazzo (Borgo Ticino). È stata qui posta proprio in ricordo delle tante donne che si recavano lungo le rive del fiume per lavare i panni[154].\n\nMonumento funebre di Ugo Foscolo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl sarcofago, situato nel Cortile delle Magnolie dell\'Università, fu realizzato dallo scultore fiorentino Antonio Berti per celebrare Ugo Foscolo poeta e docente dell’ateneo pavese per un anno (1808-1809). Il monumento è un blocco di marmo di Carrara finemente scolpito, lungo due metri e mezzo e alto 1 metro e 60.[155]\n\nObelisco di Piazza Castello[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Obelisco di piazza Castello.\n\nL\'obelisco in granito fu progettato da Giuseppe Marchesi e fu donato alla città nel 1811 dal principe Alberico Barbiano di Belgioioso.\n\nFontana dei Marinai[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nFontana monumentale per ricordare i caduti del mare: si trova in Piazza Emanuele Filiberto, all\'interno di un piccolo giardino.\n\nAree naturali e parchi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nL\'intero comune di Pavia è inserito nel Parco Naturale Lombardo della Valle del Ticino, e, oltre alle ampie fasce boschive presenti lungo le rive del fiume, sulla riva sinistra del Ticino si trovano due riserve naturali, il Bosco Grande e il Bosco Negri che rappresentano due rari esempi della originaria foresta planiziale che un tempo ricopriva la pianura Padana. A nord e a est della città, un piccolo corso d\'acqua, originato da risorgive, la Vernavola, dà origine a una profonda valle, sfuggita all\'urbanizzazione, che ospita il parco della Vernavola, mentre a ovest, l\'anello verde intorno a Pavia è chiuso dal parco della Sora. Il 9% della superficie del comune di Pavia è occupato da aree naturali, parchi o giardini (circa 594 ettari, dei quali 312 ricoperti da boschi di latifoglie[156]).\n\nIl parco della Vernavola.\nAree naturali[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nArnaldo Pomodoro, Triade, 1979, Horti Borromaici.\nParco del Ticino: parco regionale situato lungo le rive del fiume Ticino dal Lago Maggiore fino al fiume Po. Forma una cintura verde attorno alla città.\nParco della Vernavola: grande parco, erede del parco Visconteo, con una estensione di 15 ettari situato a nord della città[157], con piste ciclabili, stagni, cascine, oasi faunistiche (ingressi da Via Torretta, via Acerbi e via Folperti). È percorso dalla Roggia Vernavola, da cui prende il nome, che scorre da San Genesio al Ticino. Nel parco è inglobata la Cascina Colombara (ora sede di un museo agricolo), presso la quale si combatté nel 1525 la battaglia di Pavia, ultima della quarta guerra d\'Italia (1521-1526).\nBosco Grande: lungo l\'argine del Ticino, in sponda destra e in direzione di Zerbolò, accessibile solo a piedi o in bici. Il bosco si estende per una superficie di circa 22 ettari e rappresenta un raro residuo della foresta planiziale che un tempo ricopriva la pianura padana[158].\nBosco della Sora[157]: costeggiando il Ticino, a Nord Ovest (Parco del Ticino), si trova, presso la chiesa di San Lanfranco il parco della Sora, che si estende per circa quaranta ettari, al cui interno si trovano diversi micro-ambienti di alto valore ambientale.\nBosco Negri[157]: 34 ettari di bosco, lungo il Canale Gravellone (a sud della città), è una oasi della LIPU, all\'interno del Parco del Ticino, dono di Giuseppe Negri (1968) al Comune. L\'accesso è limitato ad alcuni periodi dell\'anno.\nLa Riserva Naturale Bosco Siro Negri\nParchi urbani[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nL\'area Vul, sullo sfondo il ponte Coperto.Area Vul: zona che costeggia la riva destra del Ticino, tra il Ponte Coperto e il Ponte della Libertà.\nOrto Botanico[159]: istituito nel 1773, si estende su una superficie di 2 ettari. È principalmente organizzato in collezioni viventi di piante quali roseto, aiuola del Te, serra delle orchidee, serra tropicale, serra delle piante utilitarie (progettate nel 1776 da Giuseppe Piermarini), arboreti, platani, aiuole di piante autoctone della Pianura Lombarda, collezioni viventi di semi e collezioni di essiccati[160]. Sorge all\'angolo fra via Scopoli e Viale Gorizia, nei pressi del Municipio.\nGiardini del Castello: piccolo parco nel cortile del castello, attrezzato con area giochi per bambini e ragazzi.\nGiardini Malaspina: giardini pubblici nel centro storico della città (piazza Petrarca), creati, nella prima metà del XIX secolo, dal marchese Luigi Malaspina come giardino del proprio palazzo e sede di concerti ed eventi culturali.\nI giardini Malaspina, 1840.Horti Borromaici: Gli Horti sono un vasto parco urbano, che copre una superficie di circa 3,5 ettari, situato all\'interno del centro storico di Pavia, tra il Collegio Borromeo (che ne è proprietario) e il Ticino, dove l\'habitat naturale s\'incontra con l\'arte contemporanea, i saperi e l\'inclusione sociale. Il parco comprende una vasta area naturalistica, dove sono stati messi oltre 3.000 alberi e arbusti autoctoni, e un\'area espositiva en plein air di arte contemporanea, dove sono esposte opere di: Arnaldo Pomodoro, Nicola Carrino, Gianfranco Pardi, Luigi Mainolfi, Mauro Staccioli, Salvatore Cuschera, Marco Lodola, Ivan Tresoldi e David Tremlett.\nGiardini Marinai d\'Italia: piccolo giardino sul lato orientale di Piazza Emanuele Filiberto con al centro la fontana monumentale dedicata ai caduti del mare\nGiardino dei Bersaglieri: davanti al Castello Visconteo, dove sorge la statua dedicata a Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nParco Leopardi: situato lontano dal centro, nel quartiere Rione Maestà.\nSocietà[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPavia ha subito a partire dagli anni \'80 del XX secolo una notevole involuzione demografica dovuta al trasferimento di molti nuclei familiari all\'interno dei comuni immediatamente confinanti al capoluogo.\nAll\'interno dell\'agglomerato urbano della città di Pavia, secondo calcoli effettuati applicando il criterio internazionale delle Functional Urban Areas, risiederebbero circa 121.000 abitanti.[161] La percentuale di popolazione anziana residente in città è, secondo i dati ISTAT, molto alta, con un indice di vecchiaia più alto rispetto alla media italiana: 245,6 contro 148,7 e con il 32,5% delle famiglie formato da anziani soli (media italiana 27,1%). Molto elevato è il livello medio d\'istruzione: il 73,1% dei residenti ha un diploma o una laurea (media italiana 55,1%, media lombarda 56%), mentre minori rispetto alla media italiana sono il tasso di mobilità per studio o lavoro fuori dal comune e il tasso di vulnerabilità materiale e sociale[162].\n\nEvoluzione demografica[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nAbitanti censiti[163]\n\n\nEtnie e minoranze straniere[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nAl 31 dicembre 2022 la popolazione straniera era di 10.379 persone, pari al 14,53% della popolazione.[164]\n\nReligione[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa prima confessione religiosa a Pavia è quella cattolica, che, diversamente da altre aree della Lombardia, è di rito romano, con l’esclusione, all’interno della città, della chiesa di San Giorgio in Montefalcone, affidata alla comunità ucraina di rito greco-cattolico[165]. La seconda comunità religiosa è quella ortodossa, come quella rumena di via Repubblica e la chiesa greco-ortodossa di Sant’Ambrogio, in via Olevano[166]. Vi è poi la musulmana, che si ritrova in due centri culturali Islamici (via San Giovannino e Via Pollack[167][168]), mentre da tempo a Pavia esistono degli edifici di culto per i protestanti, come la Chiesa valdese in via Alessandro Rolla[169], la Chiesa Evangelica delle Assemblee di Dio in via Angelo Ferrari[170], la Chiesa Evangelica della Riconciliazione, in viale Cremona[171], la Chiesa di Gesù Cristo dei Santi degli Ultimi Giorni in via Grevellone[172] e la Sala del Regno dei Testimoni di Geova in via Langosco[173].\n\nLingue e dialetti[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Dialetto pavese, Lingua lombarda e Lingua emiliana.\n\nOltre alla lingua italiana, nella città di Pavia è relativamente diffusa la lingua lombarda nella sua variante dialettale pavese. Il pavese è comunemente considerato una varietà della lingua lombarda, anche se da un punto di vista fonetico presenta molti tratti in comune con i dialetti piemontesi e, soprattutto, con il vicino dialetto piacentino, tanto che alcuni studiosi aggregano il pavese ai dialetti emiliani. Nel corso dei secoli il pavese seppe inoltre imporsi tra la popolazione anche come lingua di cultura; attraverso poesie, dizionari[174][175], riviste ed opere teatrali che si fecero portatrici delle numerose istanze sociali della città e dei suoi abitanti[176]. Tra gli autori che più hanno contribuito al panorama letterario Pavese vale la pena menzionare i poeti Siro Carati e Giuseppe Bignami.\n\nFesta del Ticino.\nIl pavese non ha un riconoscimento giuridico (legge nº 482 del 1999) e non è oggetto di tutela da parte della Repubblica Italiana, mentre la lingua lombarda è riconosciuta ufficiosamente con la Raccomandazione nº 928 del 7 ottobre 1981 del Consiglio d\'Europa. Un notevole avvicinamento del dialetto all\'italiano si è avuto, soprattutto nel corso del XX secolo, anche per via dell\'acquisizione di lessico dalla lingua nazionale (per esempio salümè rispetto a püstè \"salumiere\", ecc.), un fenomeno abbastanza comprensibile se si pensa che chi parla pavese in genere parla anche italiano.\n\nTradizioni e folclore[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa partenza del corteo del Palio del Ticino.\nUna delle più antiche tradizioni pavesi è la Festa della Sante Spine che cade il giorno dopo la Pentecoste e nella quale vengono portate in processione per la città le tre spine, custodite all’interno duomo di Pavia, ritenute parte della corona posta sulla testa di Gesù durante la Passione. Le spine originariamente erano parte della collezione di reliquie raccolte dai Visconti all’interno della cappella del castello Visconteo e furono trasportate in duomo nel 1499, poiché, in seguito alla caduta di Ludovico il Moro, si temeva che potessero essere prelevate dai francesi. La festa fu istituita dal vescovo Giovanni Battista Sfondrati nel 1645 e, oltre alle celebrazioni religiose, vede la presenza in città di mercati e luna park[177][178][179].\nDa maggio a settembre si tiene in città la Festa del Ticino dedicata al fiume che attraversa, e che ha dato vita, a Pavia. Per circa 100 giorni la città si anima con mostre, incontri, concerti, mercati e degustazioni e si conclude con uno spettacolo pirotecnico sulle acque del Ticino[180][181].\n\nPalio del Ticino.\nNel mese di giugno si tiene il Palio del Ticino che commemora la battaglia fluviale di Cremona del 1431 nella quale la flotta viscontea, guidata dal pavese Pasino Eustachi[182] e composta principalmente da galeoni e navaroli pavesi, sconfisse pesantemente la flotta veneziana, salvando così il ducato di Milano dall’invasione nemica. Il palio inizia all’interno del castello Visconteo, dove è ricreata la corte di Filippo Maria Visconti, da qui il corteo, formato da centinaia di figuranti armati, equipaggiati e vestiti come nel Quattrocento, discende fino alla basilica di San Michele, dove vengono benedette le bandiere e poi fino alla riva del Ticino e qui diverse squadre si contendono il drappo del palio in gare di tiri con l’arco e di voga con i barcé, tipiche imbarcazioni fluviali[183].\nOrmai parte delle tradizioni pavesi è l’Autunno Pavese, che si svolge dal 1948 e culmina nel mese di ottobre, quando nel palazzo delle Esposizioni si tiene un salone del gusto dedicato ai tanti prodotti enogastronomici e artigianali della provincia di Pavia[184].\n\nIstituzioni, enti e associazioni[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPer quanto gli antichi xenodochi destinati all\'accoglienza e alla cura di malati e viaggiatori sorsero in città almeno dal VIII secolo, i primi ospedali pavesi al servizio dell\'intera città di cui è rimasta traccia documentata sono l\'ospedale di Santa Maria in Betlem (attestato dal 1130) e quello di San Lazzaro (1157), che furono operativi per secoli[185]. Dopo il 1449[186], cedettero il loro ruolo primario all’Ospedale San Matteo che divenne, per incorporazioni di opere benefiche, lasciti e donazioni, una delle più importanti istituzioni pavesi. L\'antica intitolazione a San Matteo è ancora portata dal Policlinico San Matteo, il cui nome completo è Ospedale Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo[187].\n\nIl sincrotrone dello CNAO.\nIl sistema sanitario di Pavia, come quello dell\'intera Italia, non dipende più dall\'autorità locale ma è di competenza della regione, che agisce sul territorio tramite le aziende sanitarie locali. Il sito ufficiale della regione Lombardia registra a Pavia 5 ospedali[188], tra pubblici e convenzionati, specialistici o generali che coprono a 360° le patologie previste dai protocolli nazionali. A essi ricorrono sovente pazienti provenienti da altre regioni. Tra gli ospedali, sono diversi quelli che appartengono alla categoria degli Istituti di ricovero e cura a carattere scientifico, i cosiddetti IRCCS. Ricordiamo, tra quelli specialistici, l\'Istituto Nazionale Neurologico Casimiro Mondino[189] e l\'Istituto Clinico Scientifico Maugeri[190], mentre tra gli ospedali a indirizzo generale i più importanti sono l\'Istituto di Cura Città di Pavia[191] e Istituto di Riabilitazione e di Cura Santa Margherita[192]. Inoltre Pavia ospita il Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologia (Fondazione CNAO) il primo centro ospedaliero e di ricerca clinica e radiobiologica in Italia, quarto paese ad istituirne uno, creato nel 2010 dal Ministero della Salute, specializzato nel trattamento di tumori radioresistenti e/o inoperabili mediante l\'impiego di ioni carbonio e protoni, mediante l\'adroterapia[193].\nAccanto alla cura caritatevole degli ammalati, la filantropia pavese si è fatta carico, nel tempo, di fondare e sostenere istituzioni diventate poi storiche e familiari nel panorama sociale cittadino per l\'assistenza agli anziani, agli orfani e ai bisognosi: il Pio Albergo Pertusati[194] (fondato dal vescovo Francesco Pertusati nel 1752[195]), la Casa di riposo Santa Croce[196], la Fondazione Martinetti Lega del Bene[197] e la Comunità Casa del Giovane[198], nella quale i beneficati possono, nelle loro possibilità, praticare o imparare un mestiere per mantenere o crearsi la dignità personale. A questo tema si riallacciano le numerose iniziative per l\'alfabetizzazione e per l\'insegnamento delle arti e dei mestieri che troverà un largo seguito tra i protagonisti dell\'industrializzazione della città, che avvenne nel XIX secolo, come l’Istituto Pavoniano Artigianelli (attivo dal 1892 al 1967[199]). Un importante ruolo filantropico è anche svolto dalla Fondazione Banca del Monte di Lombardia[200], che ha sede nello storico Palazzo Brambilla.\nFra le istituzioni culturali con sede a Pavia va ricordata la Società Pavese di Storia Patria[201], fondata nel 1901, che unisce studiosi e cultori della storia civile, letteraria ed artistica della città e del suo territorio e che pubblica ogni anno il \"Bollettino della Società Pavese di Storia Patria”. Sempre in città si trova la sede centrale del Movimento Federalista Europeo, fondato nel 1943 da Altiero Spinelli, è movimento politico apartitico che mira alla creazione di una Federazione europea[202].\n\nCultura[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIstruzione[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nArchivi e biblioteche[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nArchivio di Stato di Pavia, chiostro dell\'ex monastero di San Maiolo (fine XV secolo- primissimi anni del XVI secolo)\nLa storia del comune di Pavia, dal X fino al XX secolo, può essere raccontata attraverso la mole di documentazione raccolta all’interno dell’Archivio Storico Civico (istituito nel 1895), che conserva anche fondi contenenti gli archivi di molte famiglie aristocratiche pavesi e di personalità cittadine, come Gaetano Sacchi, Benedetto Cairoli e Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti[203]. Anche l’Archivio di Stato (sorto nel 1959) raccoglie fondi provenienti da archivi nobiliari (Beccaria, Bottigella, Belcredi, Malaspina) e non solo, come il fondo Mori, che raccoglie le carte di Cesare Mori. Sono poi conservati all’interno dell’archivio anche gli atti dei notai pavesi (1256- 1907), le mappe del Catasto Teresiano del territorio pavese, e gli archivi dell\'università (1341-1897), dell’Ospedale San Matteo (1063- 1900), della Prefettura, della Questura e del Tribunale[204]. Altrettanto importante è l’Archivio Storico Diocesano, che custodisce la documentazione della diocesi di Pavia a partire dal X secolo[205].\nIl Centro per gli studi sulla tradizione manoscritta di autori moderni e contemporanei (Già \"Centro di ricerca sulla tradizione manoscritta di autori moderni e contemporanei\", noto anche come \"Centro Manoscritti\"), fondato da Maria Corti nel 1980, è deputato alla conservazione e allo studio del patrimonio archivistico e bibliografico moderno e contemporaneo. Il centro, fra i più importanti in Italia nel suo genere, conserva raccolte di materiale documentario (manoscritti, dattiloscritti, epistolari, prime edizioni, biblioteche, fotografie, disegni, arredi, dipinti e altri oggetti) relativo a scrittori, intellettuali, editori, artisti e scienziati degli ultimi due secoli. Tra i fondi archivistici conservati ricordiamo quelli di Alberto Arbasino, Riccardo Bacchelli, Romano Bilenchi, Emilio De Marchi, Ennio Flaiano, Alfonso Gatto, Tonino Guerra, Claudio Magris, Luigi Meneghello, Eugenio Montale, Indro Montanelli, Salvatore Quasimodo, Mario Rigoni Stern, Amelia Rosselli, Umberto Saba e Roberto Sanesi[206].\nLa tradizione bibliotecaria di Pavia tra le sue origini dalla Biblioteca Visconteo Sforzesca, istituita nella seconda metà del Trecento da Gian Galeazzo Visconti nel castello Visconteo, dove erano conservati i preziosi codici miniati dei duchi di Milano. Nel 1499, con la caduta di Ludovico il Moro, il re di Francia Luigi XII prelevò dal castello gran parte dei manoscritti e ora sono conservati nella Biblioteca nazionale di Francia a Parigi. Dei quasi mille manoscritti che costituivano la biblioteca, solo un codice è rimasto a Pavia: I Trionfi di Francesco Petrarca custodito nella Biblioteca Universitaria[207].\n\nNel seconda metà del XVI sorsero in città tre storiche biblioteche: quella del Seminario Vescovile[208] e le biblioteche dei Collegi Borromeo[209] e Ghislieri[210], fondati rispettivamente da Carlo Borromeo e da papa Pio V per permettere l’accesso all’università (allora l’unica di tutto il ducato di Milano) a giovani promettenti, ma di scarse sostanze economiche. Nel 1754, per volontà dell’imperatrice Maria Teresa venne creata la Biblioteca Universitaria, la più importante per patrimonio librario della città[211]. Nel 1887 venne istituita la Biblioteca Civica Carlo Bonetta[212], sede principale del sistema bibliotecario della città che si articola in otto punti di prestito e lettura distribuiti uniformemente sull\'intero territorio comunale[213].Giuseppe Piermarini, Biblioteca Universitaria, 1778\nFra le biblioteche universitarie vanno citate la Biblioteca di Studi Umanistici[214], nata dall\'accorpamento di diverse biblioteche delle facoltà umanistiche dell’università, come quella di archeologia (sorta nel 1819), la Biblioteca della Scienza e della Tecnica[215], dove è confluita anche la biblioteca dell’Orto Botanico (istituita nel 1773), la Biblioteca di Giurisprudenza[216] (1880), La Biblioteca delle Scienze[217], al cui interno si custodiscono anche i volumi della Società Medico Chirurgica di Pavia (fondata da Camillo Golgi nel 1885), la Biblioteca di Area Medica Adolfo Ferrata[218], la Biblioteca di Scienze Politiche[219] (sorta nel 1925), la Biblioteca di Economia[220] e la Biblioteca del Collegio Giasone del Maino (nata nel 2000[221]).\n\nScuole[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nGiancarlo De Carlo, sede della Facoltà d\'Ingegneria (1972- 1985).\nCome in altre città, a Pavia vi è un gran numero di scuole, pubbliche e private, che consentono percorsi didattici molto specifici o personalizzati a chi ha la necessità o le possibilità economiche.\n\nIl Liceo classico Ugo Foscolo.\nNel 2021 si contavano oltre 45 scuole di ogni ordine e grado, tra cui: oltre 26 scuole tra Scuola dell\'infanzia e Primaria (tra le quali una bilingue: italiano-inglese[222][223]), 8 Scuole Secondarie di Primo Grado[224] e 11 Scuole Secondarie di Secondo Grado[225]. Alcune di queste vantano secoli di Storia, come il Liceo classico Ugo Foscolo, originariamente avviato nel 1557, accanto al convento di Santa Maria di Canepanova, dai Padri Barnabiti o il Liceo Scientifico Torquato Taramelli, erede delle Scuole Normali istituite nel 1799[226].\n\nUniversità di Pavia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Scuola di Pavia e Università di Pavia.\n\nUno dei cortili dell\'Università di Pavia\nCastello di Pavia, cortile\nL\'origine dell\'Ateneo pavese risale al 25 maggio dell\'anno 825, quando l\'imperatore Lotario I emise il capitolare nel palazzo reale di Corteolona il capitolare di Olonense[227][228][229], che costituì a Pavia, capitale del Regno d\'Italia, la Schola Papiense, scuola di diritto, di retorica e arti liberali, ereditando la tradizione della scuola di diritto, fondata dall\'imperatore romano Teodosio I. l\'imperatore nominò come direttore della scuola l\'insegnante Dungallo di Bobbio[230][231][232], un monaco irlandese, maestro di retorica e scienza, astronomo e poeta, proveniente dall\'abbazia di San Colombano di Bobbio. Per tutto il periodo medioevale la scuola fu in fiorente attività. Dalla sede imperiale dipendevano gli studenti di Milano, Brescia, Lodi, Bergamo, Novara, Vercelli, Tortona, Acqui, Genova, Asti e Como. La scuola fiorì fino alla seconda metà dell\'XI secolo, per poi decadere. Nel 1361, l\'imperatore Carlo IV, su sollecitazione di Galeazzo II Visconti, istituì lo Studium Generale di Pavia. L\'Università è pertanto la prima fondata in Lombardia e una della più antiche d\'Italia\nGrande impulso venne dato in età asburgica dagli imperatori Maria Teresa d\'Asburgo e Giuseppe II, che ampliarono la sede, fondarono la Biblioteca Universitaria nel 1754 e chiamarono come docenti grandi studiosi tra i quali il fisico Alessandro Volta e il naturalista Lazzaro Spallanzani.\nInsegnarono a Pavia anche i letterati Ugo Foscolo e Vincenzo Monti.\nIn tempi più recenti si ricordano i docenti Carlo Forlanini, inventore del pneumotorace artificiale, e i premi Nobel Camillo Golgi per la medicina, Giulio Natta per la chimica e Carlo Rubbia per la fisica[233].\nL\'Università vanta un interessante museo storico che conserva, tra gli altri cimeli, strumenti scientifici costruiti da Alessandro Volta, preparazioni anatomiche settecentesche del chirurgo Antonio Scarpa, autografi di celebri docenti dell\'università e la testa dello stesso Scarpa.\nEsistono due collegi storici che ospitano, per statuto, studenti di notevoli capacità e impegno e li sostengono economicamente se privi di mezzi: l\'Almo Collegio Borromeo[234], fondato da San Carlo Borromeo nel 1563, e il Collegio Ghislieri[235], fondato sei anni dopo da Papa Pio V (Papa Ghislieri appunto, la cui statua si trova di fronte all\'ingresso del collegio). È interessante anche il giardino botanico dell\'Università, risalente al 1774. \n\nUno dei cortili dell\'Università di Pavia\nLe istituzioni studentesche e goliardiche sono state in passato particolarmente vivaci: si ricordano i versi salaci sulle donne pavesi che costarono al giovane Carlo Goldoni l\'espulsione dal collegio Ghislieri. Ancora oggi nell\'Ateneo pavese si conta la presenza di diversi Ordini goliardici che mantengono vivo il tradizionale spirito delle comunità studentesche[236].\nL\'università dispone anche di un reattore nucleare, LENA, attivo dal 1965[237] e utilizzato (come gli altri tre reattori nucleari esistenti in Italia) sia per la formazione, sia per la ricerca medica[238].\n\nScuola Universitaria superiore IUSS[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLeopoldo Pollack, Università, Aula Volta, 1787\nLeopoldo Pollack, Aula Scarpa, Università di Pavia, 1785\nL\'orto Botanico dell\'Università di Pavia, 1773\nGiuseppe Piermarini, Aula Foscolo, Università di Pavia, 1775\nL\'Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia, più brevemente IUSS, è una scuola superiore universitaria, una delle sei scuole superiori italiane dotate di autonomia[239]. Si tratta di un centro di formazione e di ricerca, che offre ai suoi studenti corsi per affiancare ai normali corsi universitari un percorso formativo di eccellenza. La Scuola IUSS è nata nel 1997 sul modello della scuola normale superiore di Pisa, attraverso un consorzio tra l\'Università di Pavia, i collegi storici della città (Borromeo, Ghislieri, Nuovo e Santa Caterina) e l\'Istituto per il diritto allo studio (EDISU) di Pavia, sulla base di un accordo con il Ministero dell\'istruzione, dell\'università e della ricerca. La Scuola IUSS fa oggi parte di una federazione delle tre Scuole Universitarie Superiori che offrono corsi a studenti universitari di ogni livello; le altre due Scuole sono la Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa e la Scuola Superiore Sant\'Anna, sempre a Pisa.\n\nMusei[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPavia possiede un notevole tesoro artistico, lascito del prestigioso passato della città, ripartito in più collezioni.\nLa Pinacoteca Malaspina, istituita dal marchese Luigi Malaspina di Sannazzaro (Pavia 1754- 1834), ospita al suo interno una collezione che contiene le opere di importanti artisti del panorama italiano e internazionale, dal XIV al XX secolo, come Gentile da Fabriano, Vincenzo Foppa, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, Bernardino Luini, Correggio, Paolo Veronese, Guido Reni, Francesco Hayez, Giovanni Segantini e Renato Guttuso. All’interno della pinacoteca è anche esposto il monumentale modello ligneo del duomo di Pavia del 1497[240]. I Musei Civici (collocati, come la pinacoteca, nel castello Visconteo) sono suddivisi in varie sezioni: Archeologica, che conserva una delle più ricche collezioni di vetri di età romana dell’Italia settentrionale e importanti opere di età longobarda, come i plutei di Santa Maria Teodote e la raccolta (la maggiore d’Italia) di epigrafi longobarde, alcune delle quali appartenenti a sepolture di re o regine. Vi e poi la sezione Romanica e Rinascimentale che espone reperti scultorei, architettonici e mosaici provenienti soprattutto da chiese ed edifici religiosi demoliti nel corso dell’Ottocento. Molto ricca è la collezione romanica, una delle più consistenti del nord Italia, che conserva anche bacini architettonici orientali importanti dall’oriente islamico e bizantino che adornavano le facciate di chiese e edifici. Sono poi esposte opere di Jacopino da Tradate, Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, Cristoforo e Antonio Mantegazza e Annibale Fontana. I Musei Civici ospitano anche il museo del Risorgimento dedicando particolare spazio alla vita sociale, economica e culturale di Pavia, alla vivacità dell’università, tra Sette e Ottocento, la Gipsoteca, la collezione di oggetti africani raccolti da Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti durante le sue esplorazioni e la raccolta numismatica, che custodisce più di 50.000 monete, gran parte di esse appartenute a Camillo Brambilla, che coprono un arco cronologico compreso tra le emissioni greche classiche e le coniazioni del periodo moderno[241].\n\nMaestro siculo-arabo, riccio pastorale, avorio (XII secolo), Museo diocesano.\nUna delle sale del Museo di storia naturale dell\'Università di Pavia\nMolto vasta è la rete museale dell’università, formata dal Museo per la storia dell’università di Pavia, diviso tra la Sezione di Medicina, dove sono esposti anche preparati anatomici e patologici, strumenti chirurgici (l\'armamentario chirurgico di Giovanni Alessandro Brambilla) e cere anatomiche a grandezza naturale, realizzate dal ceroplasta fiorentino Clemente Susini e la Sezione di Fisica che custodisce il gabinetto di fisica di Alessandro Volta[242]. Il Museo di Archeologia dell’università fu istituito da Pier Vittorio Aldini nel 1819 e custodisce reperti preistorici, egizi, greci, etruschi (tra cui una raccolta di ex voto fittili donati da papa Pio XI) e romani (alcuni provenienti da Pompei[243]). Il Museo di Storia Naturale dell’Università (Kosmos), ospitato all’interno di Palazzo Botta Adorno, è uno dei più antichi d’Italia, fu infatti fondato da Lazzaro Spallanzani nel 1771 e che conserva un patrimonio naturalistico di elevato valore scientifico e storico, comprendente quasi 400.000 reperti suddivisi tra le raccolte di zoologia, anatomia comparata e paleontologia[244]. Vi è poi il Museo Golgi, collocato negli stessi ambienti in cui operarono sia Camillo Golgi sia i suoi allievi, sale e laboratori che conservano sia gli originali arredi sia gli strumenti scientifici dell’epoca, in modo da permettere al visitatore di addentrarsi all’interno di un centro di ricerca ottocentesco[245]; mentre il Museo della Tecnica Elettrica, sorto nel 2007, illustra, all’interno di cinque sezioni la storia della tecnica elettrica[246]. Vengono poi il Museo di Chimica, quello di Fisica[247] e il Museo di Mineralogia, fondato da Lazzaro Spallanzani[248].\nA fianco del Duomo, all\'interno della cripta della antica cattedrale di Santa Maria del Popolo (XI secolo), si trova il Museo diocesano, inaugurato nel 2023, che raccoglie argenterie e oggetti liturgici (tra i quali un riccio pastorale in avorio elefantino intagliato, dipinto e dorato realizzato da una bottega siciliana per mano di artigiani arabi e risalente alla fine del XII secolo), sculture e dipinti, quali la tavola della Madonna della Misericordia di Lorenzo Fasolo[249].\nDel tutto diversa è l\'origine di FabbricaPoggi, museo, centro del design e dell\'arte contemporanea, sorto nel 2022. FabbricaPoggi è il risultato del progetto di recupero dell’ex sede dell’azienda Poggi, attiva nel secondo dopoguerra nel settore dell’arredamento e alla quale collaborarono alcune delle più importanti figure del design italiano di quei decenni. È inserita all\'interno del circuito lombardo dei musei del design[250][251].\n\nMedia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nStampa[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nA Pavia hanno sede il quotidiano la Provincia Pavese (fondato nel 1870)[252], nonché i settimanali Il Punto (esce il lunedì), Il Settimanale Pavese[253] e Il Ticino (esce il venerdì[254]).\n\nTelevisioni e Radio[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nDal 2010 è attiva Telepavia, un\'emittente televisiva regionale trasmessa in Lombardia sul canale 78 del digitale terrestre[255].\nA livello radiofonico, invece, è attiva Radio Ticino Pavia (frequenze 91.8 oppure 100.5)[256] e Radio UAU, emittente radio web.\n\nArte[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Biblioteca visconteo sforzesca e Maiolica di Pavia.\n\nGiovannino de\' Grassi, Belbello da Pavia, Offiziolo di Gian Galeazzo, Mss. Banco rari 397, Firenze, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale.\nDopo aver stabilito nel castello Visconteo la sede della corte e della Biblioteca Visconteo Sforzesca[257][258], Galeazzo II fondò in città la più prestigiosa scuola di miniatura della regione, che divenne presto celebre in tutta Europa per il suo realismo e la fine decoratività con il nome di Ouvrage de Lombardie[259].\nL\'atelier di miniatori del Visconti già dal 1370 circa aveva elaborato una raffinata fusione tra il cromatismo giottesco e i temi cortesi e cavallereschi. Protagonisti di questa prima stagione furono il miniatore anonimo autore del Guiron le Coutois e il Lancelot du Lac, oggi alla Biblioteca nazionale di Francia di Parigi, e Giovannino de\' Grassi, che miniò il libro di preghiere detto Offiziolo, con rappresentazioni di grande eleganza lineare, accuratezza naturalistica e preziosità decorativa. La generazione successiva, soprattutto nella personalità di Michelino da Besozzo, elaborò questo retaggio in maniera ancora più libera, fantasiosa e internazionale. L\'altro filone accanto allo stile dolce di Michelino fu quello grottesco, ripreso da Belbello da Pavia, caratterizzato da linee fluide e deformanti, figure fisicamente imponenti, gesti eccessivi e colori accesi e cangianti[260].\n\nPiatto, fine XVII- inizi XVIII secolo, Pavia, Musei Civici.\nLa città fu rinomata per la sua produzione di maiolica. Attestata fin dal XIII secolo[261][262], la produzione conobbe una decisa espansione tra Sei e Settecento. A Pavia vennero prodotte sia maioliche compendiarie e bianchi simili ai prodotti faentini che una vasta gamma di tipologie, come quelle calligrafiche o a tappezzeria, analoghe alle maioliche liguri[263]. La comodità dei trasporti fluviali, tramite i quali giungeva in città l’argilla dalla vicina Stradella, materia prima per la maiolica, e la presenza di numerose fornaci, spinsero diversi maestri, sia faentini, sia liguri a insediarsi in città. All’interno di questo panorama, dove stili e produzioni diverse si incontravano, influenzandosi a vicenda, si distingue la produzione degli Africa, famiglia di pittori maiolicari attivi tra la seconda metà del Seicento e i primi decenni del Settecento autori di opere conservate in numeri musei europei, nelle quali paesaggi naturali si fondono con statue e fantasiose rovine classiche, evocando così le stravaganti scenografie del palcoscenico barocco[263][264].\n\nTeatro e cinema[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl Teatro dei Quattro Nobili Cavalieri - nome originario del Fraschini, sorse nel 1772 dalla Società formata da quattro Cavalieri nobili signori pavesi: il Conte Francesco Gamberana Beccarla, il Marchese Pio Bellisomi, il Marchese Luigi Bellingeri Provera e il Conte Giuseppe de\' Giorgi Vistarino. Essi condividevano l\'amministrazione e la direzione del teatro e avevano affidato il progetto per realizzarlo ad Antonio Galli da Bibbiena, membro di un\'antica e nota famiglia di scenografi-architetti. I lavori per la costruzione del Teatro dei Quattro Nobili Cavalieri iniziarono nel 1771 e il teatro inaugurò la sua prima stagione nel 1773, alla presenza dell\'Arciduca Ferdinando d\'Austria. Il teatro fu inaugurato il 24 maggio 1773 con l\'opera Il Demetrio, composta dal compositore ceco Josef Mysliveček su versi di Pietro Metastasio.\n\nPiero Portaluppi, Politeama, 1927.\nDopo un secolo, tuttavia la Società rischiò si fallire e, di conseguenza, di chiudere il teatro. Intervenne allora il comune di Pavia, che, nel 1869, acquistò il teatro, che poi fu intitolato al tenore pavese Gaetano Fraschini[265].\nIl Politeama è un edificio in stile art déco di Pavia realizzato tra 1925 e il 1927 su progetto dell\'architetto Piero Portaluppi per ospitarvi un cinema, un teatro, attività commerciali e abitazioni[266].\nMolto più recente è la storia del CineTeatro Cesare Volta, sorto, su progetto di Mario Terzaghi e Augusto Magnaghi nel 1973, una piccola sala polifunzionale (213 posti), adatta sia a spettacoli teatrali, sia a rassegna cinematografiche e laboratori artistici\n\nCucina[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nRisotto con salsiccia e Bonarda.\nIl San Sirino.\nCapoluogo di una provincia a forma di grappolo d’uva, come venne definita da Gianni Brera, molti sono i frutti che questa terra offre e che sono all’origine di diversi piatti locali. La ricchezza di risorgive e i corsi d’acqua hanno reso Pavia, e il suo territorio, uno dei principali centri italiani per la produzione di riso, non è quindi un caso se numerose sono le ricette che permettono di scoprire i mille volti di questo cereale, come il risotto alla Certosina, secondo la leggenda ideato dai monaci della Certosa, a base di gamberi di fiume, carote e cipolle, il risotto con i fagioli dell’occhio o quello con la salsiccia e la bonarda[267] e il risotto con il luppolo selvatico[268] (in dialetto ürtis). Tra i primi piatti, oltre al riso, spicca anche la zuppa alla pavese creata, secondo la tradizione, da una contadina con i pochi ingredienti a sua disposizione (brodo, uova e formaggio) per sfamare il re di Francia Francesco I dopo la rovinosa sconfitta alle porte della città. Tra i secondi piatti va ricordato il ragò alla pavese, una variante locale della più nota cassoeula, più leggera perché cucinata solo con le costine del maiale[269], lo stufato alla pavese, la büseca (trippa di vitello alla pavese[270]), gli ossibuchi con i piselli (os büš cum i erbion[271]) e gli uccellini scappati (üslin scapà) fettine di vitello riempite di pancetta e salvia[272]. Spesso la carne, soprattutto se bollita, secondo la tradizione locale è servita insieme a due tipi di salse: la peverata (già menzionata da Opicino de Canistris nel Trecento[273]) a base di peperoni, sedano, acciughe e uova, e il bagnet verd, preparato con prezzemolo, acciughe, aglio e capperi[274]. Accanto ai piatti di carne, la cucina pavese si caratterizza anche per i numerosi piatti di pesce d’acqua dolce, come l’anguilla alla borghigiana (che prende il nome dall’antico sobborgo della città sull’altro lato del Ticino, dopo il ponte Coperto), la trota al vino bianco e la frittata con le alborelle, senza dimenticare le rane, inserite nel risotto o servite in guazzetto[275], e le lumache, cucinate con i funghi porcini[276]. Tra i dolci, oltre nota torta del paradiso, la torta di zucca (turtâ d’sücâ[277]), i San Sirini, piccoli tortini tondi formati da pan di Spagna, abbondantemente inzuppati nel rhum e ricoperti di cioccolato fondente, prodotti nelle settimane intorno al 9 dicembre, giorno di San Siro[278], e gli sfâsö, tipiche frittelle cucinate a carnevale. Chiaramente ogni portata deve essere abbinata ai vini del vicino Oltrepò Pavese. Infine, pur essendo un dolce tipico milanese, la più antica, e certa, attestazione del panettone si trova in un registro delle spese del collegio Borromeo di Pavia del 1599: il 23 dicembre di quell\'anno nell\'elenco delle portate previste per il pranzo di Natale compaiono anche le spese per 5 libbre di burro, 2 di uvetta e 3 once di spezie date al prestinaro per confezionare 13 \"pani grossi\" da donare ai collegiali il giorno di Natale[279][280].\n\nCanzoni che parlano di Pavia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nSono tanti i cantanti e i gruppi (pavesi e non) che hanno dedicato canzoni alla città di Pavia. Le più famose sono quelle del gruppo pavese 883 (allora formato da Max Pezzali e Mauro Repetto). Fra i cantautori importanti c\'è da segnalare anche Drupi, originario del quartiere Borgo Ticino. Fra i gruppi locali ci sono i \"Fio dla Nebia\"[281] e \"Quei dla Barcela\"[282], che raccontano la pavesità in canzoni in dialetto locale. Pavia viene citata anche in canzoni di cantanti non pavesi: Diesel di Eugenio Finardi, Ciao Pavia di Gianni Morandi, Questi posti davanti al mare di Ivano Fossati (cantata assieme a Fabrizio De André e Francesco De Gregori), E di Luciano Ligabue.[283].\n\nFilm girati a Pavia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPavia negli anni è stata scelta come location da diversi registi per i loro film. Una delle pellicole più famose e riuscite è stata Il cappotto, di Alberto Lattuada. Il film, girato nel 1952, fu proiettato anche al Festival di Cannes con grandi riconoscimenti anche per l’interpretazione di Renato Rascel[284]. Nel 1957 fu girato I sogni nel cassetto di Renato Castellani, ritenuto «di gran lunga il migliore film di Castellani»[285]. A Pavia sono stati ambientati e girati alcuni film del regista Stelvio Massi come Squadra volante (1971), 5 donne per l\'assassino (1974) e Mark il poliziotto (1975). Inoltre, furono girante alcune sequenze di Liberi armati pericolosi (1976) del regista Romolo Guerrieri. Dario Argento vi girò parte del suo unico film non appartenente ai generi thriller o horror: Le cinque giornate (1973) con Adriano Celentano. Anche Ermanno Olmi girò in centro storico alcune scene del film L\'albero degli zoccoli (1978), che vinse la Palma d\'oro al Festival di Cannes. Nel 1976 fu girato La orca del regista Eriprando Visconti, nipote del noto Luchino, con Michele Placido, Vittorio Mezzogiorno e Flavio Bucci. Nel 1981 Dino Risi girò Fantasma d\'amore, con Marcello Mastroianni e Romy Schneider, tratto dall’omonimo romanzo dello scrittore pavese Mino Milani[284]. Alcune scene della commedia Il ragazzo di campagna (1984) di Castellano e Pipolo con Renato Pozzetto furono girate a Pavia e dintorni[286]; così come la sequenza (in località bivio Gramegna) del film I cammelli (1988) di Giuseppe Bertolucci con Paolo Rossi e Claudio Bisio[287]. Sempre nel 1988 la regista tedesca Margarethe von Trotta girò in università e in centro storico Paura e amore, trasposizione cinematografica dell\'opera Tre sorelle di Anton Cechov (su sceneggiatura di Dacia Maraini), con Valeria Golino, Sergio Castellitto e Paolo Hendel[288]. Negli anni ’90 ricordiamo Facciamo paradiso di Mario Monicelli con Margherita Buy e Lello Arena tra gli attori principali, con le scene girate all’interno dell’Università. Più recentemente in vari punti della città sono state girate alcune sequenze dei film Magic Card (2015) con Maria Grazia Cucinotta[289]; lo storico Aquile randagie (2019)[290], il biografico Hammamet (2020) di Gianni Amelio, sulla vita di Bettino Craxi[291]. Nel 2014 ha debuttato alla regia il pavese d\'adozione Giuseppe Di Giorgio, che ha ambientato il suo primo film interamente a Pavia dal titolo La Giusta Scelta, seguito da: La scelta impossibile (2018), che tratta tematiche come la criminalità organizzata e la prostituzione (con Giuseppe Di Giorgio e Nathalie Caldonazzo); il thriller Stem Cell (2020) diretto ed interpretato da Giuseppe Di Giorgio, ambientato tra l\'Istituto di ricovero e cura a carattere scientifico Mondino di Pavia e la Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia; Finalmente libera (2021), una commedia diretta da Giuseppe Di Giorgio con la partecipazione di Vera Castagna; e infine l\'ultimo film diretto ed interpretato da Giuseppe Di Giorgio, di genere thriller, che tratta in maniera del tutto originale la delicata tematica del femminicidio, dal titolo Tenebra - Questa è la mia vendetta (2022), tratto dal romanzo Tenebra di David Pratelli.\n\nGeografia antropica[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nUrbanistica[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Strade e piazze di Pavia.\n\nDal punto di vista urbanistico, la città ricalca la struttura romana attorno agli assi viari principali: il cardo, che corrisponde all\'attuale Corso Strada Nuova, e il decumano che corrisponde all\'attuale Corso Cavour a ovest e Corso Mazzini a est. La stessa planimetria a scacchiera di gran parte degli isolati del centro storico ricalca quasi fedelmente le insulae della città romana, come prova la rete fognaria di età romana, che si è conservata quasi integralmente[292][293].\nUn altro asse viario di grande rilevanza, soprattutto nel Medioevo, è costituito dall\'odierno Corso Garibaldi (prosegue in centro storico come Via Cardano), che si snoda parallelo alla parte orientale del decumano lungo la strada che porta verso Piacenza e Cremona. Molti furono poi i monumenti gotici in città.\n\nFrazioni[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl castello di Mirabello.\nIl comune di Pavia si venne formando nei secoli scorsi attraverso l\'aggregazione di diversi comuni. Fino al 1883 esistette un comune dei Corpi Santi di Pavia (CC D036) che raggruppava le cascine e i sobborghi della città appena fuori dalle mura. Le località meno prossime al centro appartenevano a tre delle entità amministrative in cui era diviso il Pavese, cioè il Parco Visconteo, la Campagna Sottana e la Campagna Soprana.\n\nAlbertario\nCà della Terra, attestato almeno dal XV secolo[294], nel 1797 venne assegnato al distretto di Belgioioso[295]. Nel 1871 il comune venne soppresso e fu aggregato a quello di Fossarmato[296], che, nel 1939, confluì in quello di Pavia.\nCà de\' Tedioli, documentato almeno del XIV secolo[297], non era un vero e proprio centro abitato accentrato, ma una comunità che riuniva cascine e casolari posti esternamente ai sobborghi orientali della città. Nel 1870 venne annesso al comune dei Corpi Santi[298].\nCantugno\nCascina Montebello\nCassine Sirigari\nCittadella\nFossarmato, la località risulta già menzionata nel XII secolo tra i possedimenti del monastero di San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro[299] e nel XIV secolo vi sorgeva un castello (ora scomparso) appartenente alla famiglia pavese degli Avvocati[300]. Nel 1939 il comune venne soppresso e confluì in quello di Pavia[301].\nMirabello, la località sorse intorno al XII secolo presso il monastero cistercense del Gesù. Nella prima metà del XIV secolo la famiglia aristocratica pavese di Fiamberti vi eresse un castello, poi espropriato da Galeazzo II Visconti negli anni \'60 del Trecento[302]. Attorno al castello venne creato il grande Parco Visconteo, all\'interno del quale si svolse la battaglia di Pavia del 1525. Il comune di Mirabello venne soppresso nel 1939 e fu unito a quello di Pavia[303].\nMolinazzo\nPantaleona\nVillalunga\nEconomia[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nAgricoltura[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl 63,3% della superficie del comune di Pavia (circa 4.000 ettari[304]) è destinata all’agricoltura e in particolare alla coltivazione del riso (circa 2.400 ettari), diffusasi, a partire dal XV secolo, prevalentemente nei terreni paludosi sino a divenire, soprattutto dal XVIII secolo, la principale coltivazione. Le grandi quantità d\'acqua richieste per il riso ha fatto sì che nel corso dei secoli sia stata progettata e realizzata una fittissima rete d\'irrigazione che ancor oggi caratterizza il paesaggio della campagna pavese. Va poi evidenziato che la città è capoluogo delle provincia italiana con la più grande produzione di riso del paese: oltre 84.000 ettari del suolo provinciale sono destinati a risaia[305]. Le altre colture presenti all’interno del territorio comunale sono quella del mais e del grano (1.376 ettari), i pioppeti (636 ettari), mentre superfici molto limitate sono destinate ai prati (158 ettari), ai frutteti e agli orti (29,30 ettari). Sempre all\'interno del territorio del comune di Pavia sono ancora attive quasi una cinquantina di cascine (aziende agricole) destinate all\'attività agricola[306], 18 di esse ospitano allevamenti bovini, dove vengono allevati circa 820 capi[307].\n\nArtigianato[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nNel settore dell\'artigianato sono molto diffuse e rinomate la produzione artigianale di attrezzi agricoli e la lavorazione del metallo.[308]\nInoltre sono significative le lavorazioni del ferro battuto finalizzata agli edifici pubblici, quella della ceramica e della porcellana.\n\nIndustria[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa città conobbe un forte sviluppo dell’industria a partire dagli anni’80 dell’Ottocento, tanto che ospitò anche stabilimenti di importanza nazionale, come la Necchi o la prima grande fabbrica italiana di seta artificiale e tessuti sintetici, la Snia Viscosa, sorta nel 1905. Nel 1951 quasi il 27% della forza lavoro di Pavia era addetta al settore industriale[309]. A partire dagli anni ’70 del XX secolo la città subì una repentina deindustrializzazione che portò alla chiusura di molte aziende, soprattutto quelle dei settori chimico e meccanico, mentre conobbero sviluppo quelle legate al settore alimentare[310], come la Riso Scotti, le aziende farmaceutiche e quelle legate alla filiera del packaging[311]. Fortemente in crescita è, infine, il settore della microelettronica che, grazie alla collaborazione tra università e operatori privati, ha visto nascere a Pavia un micro-distretto ad alta specializzazione che offre lavoro a oltre 500 ingegneri elettronici e dottori di ricerca, tanto che anche alcune grandi aziende del settore, come la STMicroelectronics, hanno creato centri di ricerca insieme all\'ateneo pavese[312].\n\nTurismo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPavia ha fatto parte del circuito delle città d\'arte della Pianura Padana dal 1999 al 2018, anno di scioglimento dell\'ente[313]. A partire dagli anni duemila il turismo ha rappresentato un settore in forte espansione sul territorio: nel 2018 il territorio provinciale si era qualificato come uno dei più attrattivi della regione per quanto riguardava il turismo nazionale[314], mentre nel 2019 la provincia di Pavia attirò 233.517 arrivi e contò 487.485 pernottamenti[315], dei quali, rispettivamente, 56.604 e 107.831 nel solo comune di Pavia[316].\nNel 2020, anno durante quale il turismo fu pesantemente colpito dalla pandemia di Covid 19, la provincia di Pavia (insieme alla provincia di Sondrio) \"assorbì\" meglio di altri territori lombardi gli effetti negativi delle limitazioni imposte dal virus con una contrazione del -52,6% per quanto riguarda gli arrivi e del -46,7% per i pernottamenti (la media regionale fu -66,3% per gli arrivi e -60,8% per i pernottamenti[317]).\n\nInfrastrutture e trasporti[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nStrade[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl ponte della Libertà (1936).\nSituata lungo la strada statale 35 dei Giovi, Pavia dispone anche di due uscite autostradali sull\'autostrada A7, entrambe poste però al di fuori del territorio comunale (Pavia Nord si trova nel comune di Bereguardo e Pavia Sud in quello di Gropello Cairoli).\nLa città di Pavia possiede tre tangenziali: due con caratteristiche autostradali, dotate di due corsie per ogni senso di marcia (autostrada A54, detta anche tangenziale ovest, e un raccordo autostradale, chiamato autostrada A53, che collega la città con l\'autostrada A7 in corrispondenza del casello autostradale di Pavia Nord-Bereguardo), e una con una corsia per ogni senso di marcia, che collega la tangenziale A54 con la strada statale 617 Bronese, che porta verso il Ponte della Becca (la cosiddetta tangenziale nord ed est).\nNumerose strade si diramano dalla città (le più importanti sono: la SP ex SS 234 Pavia-Cremona, la SP ex SS 235 Pavia-Brescia, la SS 526 Pavia-Magenta e la SS 617 Pavia-Broni).\n\nFerrovie e tranvie[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nStazione ferroviaria di Pavia (1862).Pavia è dotata di tre stazioni ferroviarie:\nLa stazione di Pavia, posta lungo la ferrovia Milano-Genova, è fermata di treni a breve e a lunga percorrenza diretti verso località italiane, austriache e tedesche. Inaugurata nel 1867[318], è servita da treni regionali e suburbani di Trenord (nell\'ambito del contratto di servizio stipulato con la Regione Lombardia), da collegamenti a lunga percorrenza (Frecciarossa, Frecciabianca, Intercity, Intercity notte, regionali veloci) operati da Trenitalia, da collegamenti ad alta velocità gestiti da Italo-NTV[319] e da collegamenti internazionali (Euronight) operati dalle Ferrovie Austriache[320]. Costituisce località di diramazione per le linee Pavia-Cremona, Pavia-Vercelli, Pavia-Alessandria (via Valenza) e capolinea meridionale della linea suburbana S13 per Milano Nord Bovisa - Politecnico.\nLa stazione di Pavia Porta Garibaldi, fermata posta sulla linea ferroviaria Pavia-Cremona, è collegata alla principale stazione pavese con un tempo di percorrenza di circa 6 minuti. Situata presso il naviglio pavese, in Viale Sardegna, serve il quartiere di San Giovannino, la zona di Viale Partigiani e il Cimitero monumentale.\nLa stazione di Motta San Damiano, fermata posta sulla linea ferroviaria Pavia-Cremona, è situata all\'interno del territorio comunale, ma serve l\'adiacente centro abitato di Motta San Damiano, frazione del comune di Valle Salimbene.\nIn passato erano attive fra il 1880 e il 1936 la tranvia Milano-Pavia e tra il 1884 e il 1934 la tranvia Pavia-Sant\'Angelo Lodigiano.\n\nMobilità urbana ed extraurbana[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl servizio di trasporto su strada, sia urbano sia extraurbano, è assicurato da autoservizi svolti dalla società Autoguidovie. In città operano 10 linee urbane diurne, una linea urbana notturna, 5 linee suburbane e 5 linee dedicate agli studenti. Numerose sono le autolinee extraurbane che fanno capolinea presso l\'autostazione di via Trieste, a poca distanza dalla stazione ferroviaria, che collegano frequentemente Pavia con altre città (Milano, Vigevano, Lodi, Voghera, Castel San Giovanni, Varzi, ecc.). Nei paraggi dell\'autostazione si fermano anche alcune linee a lunga percorrenza (MarinoBus, Eurobus Consorzio Autolinee, Gruppo STAT) che garantiscono collegamenti giornalieri e periodici con il Centro e il Sud Italia.\nIn passato era presenta una linea tranviaria urbana, che operò fra il 1913 e il 1954, sostituita da una filovia a sua volta soppressa nel 1968 (i percorsi della tranvia e della filovia sono sostituiti da due linee della rete di autoservizi cittadina).\n\nBike sharing[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nÈ inoltre attivo un servizio di bike sharing attivo 24 ore su 24, denominato Pavia in Bici, che consente, a seguito della sottoscrizione di un\'apposita tessera, di utilizzare le biciclette poste in 7 stazioni nel territorio cittadino. Le stazioni sono collocate nei seguenti luoghi: sul piazzale della Stazione Ferroviaria (dove il servizio può essere integrato con il trasporto ferroviaria e in particolare con la linea suburbana S13 Pavia- Milano di Trenord), in piazzale Golgi (vicino al Policlinico San Matteo), in piazza Vittoria, in via Indipendenza, in piazza Leonardo da Vinci (nei pressi dell\'Università), in via Ferrata e in via dei Mille dopo il ponte Coperto[321].\n\nCar sharing[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nSul territorio comunale sono presenti cinque postazioni dove è possibile noleggiare auto tramite il car sharing. Le postazioni si trovano: sul piazzale della Stazione Ferroviaria (dove il servizio può essere integrato con il trasporto ferroviaria e in particolare con la linea suburbana S13 Pavia- Milano di Trenord), in piazzale Golgi (vicino al Policlinico San Matteo), in piazza Italia (nei pressi dell\'università), in strada Cascina Cascinazza e in piazzale San Giuseppe. Gli autoveicoli che svolgono il servizio di car sharing hanno l\'accesso gratuito nelle zone del centro storico a traffico limitato (ZTL[322]).\n\nIdroscalo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nL\'ex Idroscalo (1926).\nL\'idroscalo di Pavia venne inaugurato il 1º aprile 1926 da Benito Mussolini per servire come punto di rifornimento e sosta per gli idrovolanti della linea Torino-Venezia-Trieste[323] della Società Italiana Servizi Aerei. Cessato da tempo il suo utilizzo, l\'infrastruttura versa in stato di abbandono.\nNel 1999 la struttura è stata venduta[324] a privati per il risanamento e la realizzazione di spazi commerciali e nel 2017 ha ottenuto il via libera dalla Commissione Paesaggio per la riqualificazione.\n\nAeroporti[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa città di Pavia è facilmente raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici dagli aeroporti milanesi. Dai terminal di Malpensa con il servizio ferroviario del Malpensa Express si raggiunge la stazione di Milano Nord Bovisa dalla quale partono ogni 30 minuti (dalle ore 5:25 alle ore 23:25) i treni suburbani della linea S13 per Pavia. Invece, dal terminal di Linate con la metropolitana dell\'ATM (linea M4) si raggiunge la stazione di Milano Dateo dalla quale partono ogni 30 minuti (dalle ore 5:41 alle ore 23:41) i treni suburbani della linea S13 per Pavia.\n\nProgetto IRMA[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl Ticino a valle della città, sullo sfondo il duomo e il monte Rosa.\nNell\'ambito del programma quadro di ricerca Horizon 2020[325], il 21 maggio 2014 da una collaborazione fra il dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\'Università e il Comune di Pavia è nata IRMA, acronimo di Integrated Real-time Mobility Assistant, progetto pilota europeo di un\'applicazione gratuita per sistemi Android e Internet[326], che è in grado di tracciare la posizione geografica e ottimizzare un itinerario di trasporto intermodale di persone e in ambito urbano verso la destinazione prescelta, basandosi su dati aggiornati in tempo reale riguardo a: traffico, meteo, viabilità e presenza di mezzi pubblici.\nL\'applicazione viene sperimentata in 5 \"città intelligenti\", con mappe interattive e supporto multilingua, e ulteriori estensioni in Braille, Smart TV e di interfaccia utente a favore di persone anziane, ipovedenti e diversamente abili[327]. Profilatura e analisi del traffico hanno tra i loro potenziali portatori di interesse i seguenti soggetti: municipalità, aziende di trasporti, fornitori di servizi informativi.\nIl team progettuale ha stimato una riduzione dell\'inquinamento urbano da automobili di una percentuale sino al 30-40%, e un simile bilanciamento fra la domanda di mezzi pubblici prevista e quella effettivamente riscontrata in tempo reale. Il progetto è sviluppato con il contributo di giovani ricercatori, servizi cloud (Platform as a service), nonché riuso di codice e programmi a sorgente aperto[328].\n\nAmministrazione[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Sindaci di Pavia.\n\nSindaci del Comune di Pavia dal dopoguerra[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\nPeriodo\n\nPrimo cittadino\n\nPartito\n\nCarica\n\nNote\n\n\n1945\n\n1946\n\nAngelo Grassi\n\nCLN\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1946\n\n1948\n\nCornelio Fietta\n\n\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1948\n\n1951\n\nCarlo Milani\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1951\n\n1956\n\nAlberto Ricevuti\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1956\n\n1964\n\nBruno Fassina\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\nGiovanni Vaccari\n\nPSI\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1970\n\n\n\nGianpaolo Calvi\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\nProsindaco\n\n\n1970\n\n\n\nSesto Bajno\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1970\n\n1971\n\nAngelo Biancardi\n\nPSI\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1971\n\n1973\n\nMognaschi\n\n\n\nCommissario prefettizio\n\n-\n\n\n1973\n\n1980\n\nElio Veltri\n\nPSI\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1980\n\n1986\n\nGiorgio Maini\n\nPCI\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1986\n\n1988\n\nPierangelo Giovanolla\n\nPCI\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\nSandro Bruni\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1990\n\n1993\n\nSandro Cantone\n\nDemocrazia Cristiana\n\nSindaco\n\n-\n\n\n1993\n\n\n\nDomenico Gorgoglione\n\n\n\nCommissario prefettizio\n\n-\n\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\nRodolfo Jannaccone Pazzi\n\nLega Nord\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 1993\n\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\nDomenico Gorgoglione\n\n\n\nCommissario prefettizio\n\n-\n\n\n1996\n\n2005\n\nAndrea Albergati\n\nPPI\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 1996 e 2000\n\n\n2005\n\n2009\n\nPiera Capitelli\n\nDS/PD\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 2005\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\nLaura Bianchi\n\n\n\nCommissario prefettizio\n\n-\n\n\n2009\n\n2014\n\nAlessandro Cattaneo\n\nPDL/FI\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 2009\n\n\n2014\n\n2019\n\nMassimo Depaoli\n\nPD\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 2014\n\n\n2019\n\n2019\n\nFlavio Ferdani\n\n\n\nCommissario prefettizio\n\n-\n\n\n2019\n\nin carica\n\nFabrizio Fracassi\n\nLega Nord\n\nSindaco\n\nElezioni 2019\n\n\nGemellaggi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl movimento delle città gemellate nasce dopo la seconda guerra mondiale per iniziativa di Jean-Marie Bressand che promuove la costituzione di \"Monde Bilingue\" che puntava a realizzare attraverso un\'educazione bilingue la conoscenza tra i popoli come base per una pace duratura. Nel 1957 viene creata la Federazione Mondiale delle Città Gemellate[329].\nPavia è gemellata con:[330]\n\n Besançon (1965)\nBesançon è stata la prima città gemellata con Pavia, con delibera del Consiglio Comunale del 9 luglio 1965. La decisione è stato l\'ultimo atto di un lungo percorso iniziato nel 1961, per iniziativa di un cittadino di Voghera, nazionalizzato francese, che aveva promosso presso il comune transalpino l\'idea di un gemellaggio con Pavia, come si legge nell\'atto di promessa di gemellaggio del Consiglio comunale[331].\n\n Vilnius (1975)\n Hildesheim (2000)\nIl gemellaggio è legato alla figura di Sant’Epifanio (438-497) vescovo di Pavia. Il Vescovo di Hildesheim Otwino venuto nel 962 a Pavia a seguito di Ottone I decise di trasferire la gran parte dei resti del santo alla cattedrale di Hildesheim[332]. Alcune ossa rimaste sono conservate nella chiesa pavese di San Francesco.\n\n Hersbruck (2004)\nIl gemellaggio con la città tedesca nasce nel ricordo di Teresio Olivelli, partigiano cattolico, beatificato nel 1992, e morto nel lager nazista delle SS presso Hersbruck il 17 gennaio 1945 mentre tentava di difendere un altro prigioniero. Questo ricordo è stato fonte di numerosi contatti tra le due città e nel 2003 il sindaco di Hersbruck, durante un convegno a Pavia ha proposto il gemellaggio[333].\n\n Betlemme (2006)\n Zante (2006)\n Ayamé\nSport[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\n\n\n\nQuesta voce o sezione  sull\'argomento Lombardia non è ancora formattata secondo gli standard.\nCommento: sezione da adeguare al modello di voce\nContribuisci a migliorarla secondo le convenzioni di Wikipedia.

Attiva nel maschile fin dal 1933, la piazza può vantare 21 partecipazioni a campionati di massima serie e 20 a campionati cadetti, la conquista di un titolo nazionale universitario (campionato Littoriali, nel 1939) e di una Coppa Italia LNP (nel 2001). Nel corso degli anni a Pavia hanno giocato sportivi illustri come il fuoriclasse Oscar Schmidt, i nazionali Tullio Rochlitzer, Raffaele Rosolen, Carlo Montemartini, Roberto Premier, Fabio Di Bella e il giovane Danilo Gallinari. Il miglior piazzamento a livello maschile è stato il 3º posto in massima serie della Pallacanestro Pavia nel campionato 1955/56, mentre a livello femminile la squadra dell\'Onda Pavia si è classificata in 2ª posizione in serie A nella stagione 1963/64.[349] Pavia è l’unico club di tutta la provincia che ha conquistato uno scudetto juniores nazionale (U19 femminile) e ha disputato una competizione europea (la Coppa Ronchetti): avvenne con la SIVE ASD Basket Pavia femminile nella stagione 1997/98, anche se per motivi di “sponsor” le gare interne furono giocate a Novara e al Palalido di Milano[350]. Oggi le principali squadre di pallacanestro rimaste sono la rinata Pallacanestro Pavia 1933[351] (che milita in serie B2) e la Sanmaurense Pavia[352] (che milita in serie C).\n\nPallavolo[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa pallavolo femminile in passato ha disputato qualche stagione di serie A1 e di A2 con la Riso Scotti Minerva Pavia (dal 2005 al 2015). Attualmente esistono le squadre dell\'Universo in Volley Pavia[353] (che milita in serie B/1 femminile)[354] e del CUS Pavia Pallavolo[355] impegnato nei campionati minori. Dalla stagione 2021/22 il PalaRavizza ospita le gare casalinghe di serie A3 maschile del Volley 2001 di Garlasco.[356]\n\nRugby[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nIl rugby è rappresentato in città dal Cus Pavia che, dal minirugby alla Serie C e al rugby femminile, coinvolge dal 1933 molte generazioni di giovani rugbisti pavesi[357]. La squadra ha militato in serie A dal 1941 al 1943, e più recentemente in serie B dal 2003 al 2005.[358]\n\nWrestling[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nLa città è sede della ICW.\n\nImpianti sportivi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nPrincipali impianti sportivi presenti in città:\n\nStadio \"Pietro Fortunati\"\nPalazzetto dello Sport \"Giuliano Ravizza\"\nPalaChiappero (dedicato al basket giovanile e altri sport).[359]\nPalaCUS (dedicato alla pallavolo, alla scherma, al tiro con l’arco e all’arrampicata sportiva).[360]\nPalaCampus (dove vengono praticate le attività giovanili di pallavolo e le attività adattate sviluppate in collaborazione con il Corso di Laurea in Scienze Motorie Preventive e Adattate dell’Università di Pavia).[360]\nCus Pavia - Sede Nautica (dove si svolgono le attività di canoa e canottaggio).[360]\nCampo Rugby Cravino.[361]\nPiscine Campus Aquae.[362]\nEventi sportivi[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nTorneo Internazionale Giovanile di Tennis Under 14[363]: si svolge dal 2003 al Tennis Club Pavia[364], nella primavera di ogni anno, e ne prendono parte 32 ragazzi e 32 ragazze tra i migliori in Europa.

La gara si svolge in due manche con imbarcazioni a otto vogatori (8+). Gli equipaggi (maschili) sono interamente composti da studenti regolarmente iscritti ai due Atenei e alcuni di loro fanno anche parte della nazionale italiana di canottaggio. L\'albo d\'oro vede Pavia condurre con 36 vittorie.\nPalio del Ticino: si svolge il secondo week-end di giugno. Nato nel 2006, si ispira alla storica Battaglia fluviale di Pavia del 1431.[365]\nRaid Pavia-Venezia: si svolge dal 1929 nel mese di giugno ed è il raid di motonautica più lungo al mondo corso in acque interne. La manifestazione si articola lungo un percorso di 413 km con partenza da Pavia dalla sede dell\'Associazione Motonautica (sulle acque del fiume Ticino), con marcia di trasferimento a velocità ridotta sino al Ponte della Becca (confluenza con il Po), poi, di seguito, verso le altre tappe (Isola Serafini, Boretto, Volta Grimana) e l\'arrivo a Chioggia e poi all\'Arsenale di Venezia[366].\nNazionale Under-21 di calcio dell\'Italia. La Nazionale U-21 ha disputato due partite allo stadio \"Pietro Fortunati\" di Pavia: nel settembre 2003 contro il Galles (vittoria italiana per 8-1) e nel marzo 2005 contro la Scozia (vittoria italiana per 2-0)[367][368].\nGiro d\'Italia: la 16ª tappa dell\'edizione 2003 si è conclusa il 26 maggio a Pavia con la vittoria di Alessandro Petacchi.\nPallavolo femminile: nel 2010 il Palasport \"Giuliano Ravizza\" di Pavia ha ospitato la Supercoppa italiana di pallavolo femminile[369].\nNazionale di Pallacanestro Femminile dell\'Italia: nel febbraio 2018 contro la Macedonia, la Nazionale Femminile di basket ha disputato al Palasport \"Giuliano Ravizza\" di Pavia una gara valida per le qualificazioni europee 2019 (vittoria italiana per 93-33)[370].\nMille Miglia: la storica competizione automobilistica stradale ha fatto tappa a Pavia (controllo timbro) nel 2022[371] e nel 2023[372].\nMilano-SanRemo: la 115ª edizione della storica gara ciclistica svoltasi il 16 marzo 2024 è partita da Pavia[373].\nSport acquatici[modifica | modifica wikitesto]\nDalla fine dell\'800 a tempi più recenti sono nate una serie di associazioni, che con il tempo hanno ampliato la loro attività a diverse altre discipline sportive acquatiche.\n\nSocietà Canottieri Ticino[374], fondata nel 1873 come società di canottaggio, mantiene la tradizione dei barcé.\nBattellieri Colombo[375], nata da una costola della Cannottieri Ticino nel 1885.\nAssociazione Motonautica Pavia[376]: dal 1929 si concentra subito sulla promozione delle attività sportive acquatiche, in particolar modo nella promozione dell\'annuale raid Pavia-Venezia.\nClub Vogatori Pavesi[377]: fondata nel 1983, organizza attività ed iniziative culturali e sportive legate alla voga alla pavese su barcè e al fiume Ticino, alla sua vita, cultura e salvaguardia.\nCus Pavia[378], sezione canottaggio e canoa: fondato nel 1946, ha ereditato la tradizione tramandata dalle più antiche società remiere pavesi.

of mind\nSocial and political philosophers\nWomen in philosophy\nvte\nPhilosophy (Ï†Î¹Î»Î¿ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¯Î±, \'love of wisdom\', in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own methods and assumptions.\nHistorically, many of the individual sciences, such as physics and psychology, formed part of philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term. Influential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western, Arabicâ€“Persian, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. Western philosophy originated in Ancient Greece and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields. A central topic in Arabicâ€“Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and revelation. Indian philosophy combines the spiritual problem of how to reach enlightenment with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge. Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues in relation to right social conduct, government, and self-cultivation.\nMajor branches of philosophy are epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics. Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it. Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct. Logic is the study of correct reasoning and explores how good arguments can be distinguished from bad ones. Metaphysics examines the most general features of reality, existence, objects, and properties. Other subfields are aesthetics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of history, and political philosophy. Within each branch, there are competing schools of philosophy that promote different principles, theories, or methods.\nPhilosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge. They include conceptual analysis, reliance on common sense and intuitions, use of thought experiments, analysis of ordinary language, description of experience, and critical questioning. Philosophy is related to many other fields, including the sciences, mathematics, business, law, and journalism. It provides an interdisciplinary perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields. It also investigates their methods and ethical implications.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word philosophy comes from the Ancient Greek words Ï†Î¯Î»Î¿Ï‚ (philos) \'love\' and ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¯Î± (sophia) \'wisdom\'.[2][a] Some sources say that the term was coined by the pre-Socratic philosopher Pythagoras, but this is not certain.[4]\n\nPhysics was originally part of philosophy, like Isaac Newton\'s observation of how gravity affects falling apples.\nThe word entered the English language primarily from Old French and Anglo-Norman starting around 1175 CE. The French philosophie is itself a borrowing from the Latin philosophia. The term philosophy acquired the meanings of \"advanced study of the speculative subjects (logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics)\", \"deep wisdom consisting of love of truth and virtuous living\", \"profound learning as transmitted by the ancient writers\", and \"the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, and the basic limits of human understanding\".[5]\nBefore the modern age, the term philosophy was used in a wide sense. It included most forms of rational inquiry, such as the individual sciences, as its subdisciplines.[6] For instance, natural philosophy was a major branch of philosophy.[7] This branch of philosophy encompassed a wide range of fields, including disciplines like physics, chemistry, and biology.[8] An example of this usage is the 1687 book PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton. This book referred to natural philosophy in its title, but it is today considered a book of physics.[9]\nThe meaning of philosophy changed toward the end of the modern period when it acquired the more narrow meaning common today. In this new sense, the term is mainly associated with philosophical disciplines like metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Among other topics, it covers the rational study of reality, knowledge, and values. It is distinguished from other disciplines of rational inquiry such as the empirical sciences and mathematics.[10]\n\nConceptions of philosophy\nSee also: Metaphilosophy\nGeneral conception\nThe practice of philosophy is characterized by several general features: it is a form of rational inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions.[11] It requires attentively thinking long and carefully about the provocative, vexing, and enduring problems central to the human condition.[12]\nThe philosophical pursuit of wisdom involves asking general and fundamental questions. It often does not result in straightforward answers but may help a person to better understand the topic, examine their life, dispel confusion, and overcome prejudices and self-deceptive ideas associated with common sense.[13] For example, Socrates stated that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" to highlight the role of philosophical inquiry in understanding one\'s own existence.[14][15] And according to Bertrand Russell, \"the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason.\"[16]\n\nAcademic definitions\nMain article: Definitions of philosophy\nAttempts to provide more precise definitions of philosophy are controversial[17] and are studied in metaphilosophy.[18] Some approaches argue that there is a set of essential features shared by all parts of philosophy. Others see only weaker family resemblances or contend that it is merely an empty blanket term.[19] Precise definitions are often only accepted by theorists belonging to a certain philosophical movement and are revisionistic according to SÃ¸ren Overgaard et al. in that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title \"philosophy\" if they were true.[20]\nSome definitions characterize philosophy in relation to its method, like pure reasoning. Others focus on its topic, for example, as the study of the biggest patterns of the world as a whole or as the attempt to answer the big questions.[21] Such an approach is pursued by Immanuel Kant, who holds that the task of philosophy is united by four questions: \"What can I know?\"; \"What should I do?\"; \"What may I hope?\"; and \"What is the human being?\"[22] Both approaches have the problem that they are usually either too wide, by including non-philosophical disciplines, or too narrow, by excluding some philosophical sub-disciplines.[23]\nMany definitions of philosophy emphasize its intimate relation to science.[24] In this sense, philosophy is sometimes understood as a proper science in its own right. According to some naturalistic philosophers, such as W. V. O. Quine, philosophy is an empirical yet abstract science that is concerned with wide-ranging empirical patterns instead of particular observations.[25] Science-based definitions usually face the problem of explaining why philosophy in its long history has not progressed to the same extent or in the same way as the sciences.[26] This problem is avoided by seeing philosophy as an immature or provisional science whose subdisciplines cease to be philosophy once they have fully developed.[27] In this sense, philosophy is sometimes described as \"the midwife of the sciences\".[28]\nOther definitions focus on the contrast between science and philosophy. A common theme among many such conceptions is that philosophy is concerned with meaning, understanding, or the clarification of language.[29] According to one view, philosophy is conceptual analysis, which involves finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of concepts.[30] Another definition characterizes philosophy as thinking about thinking to emphasize its self-critical, reflective nature.[31] A further approach presents philosophy as a linguistic therapy. According to Ludwig Wittgenstein, for instance, philosophy aims at dispelling misunderstandings to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of ordinary language.[32]\nPhenomenologists, such as Edmund Husserl, characterize philosophy as a \"rigorous science\" investigating essences.[33] They practice a radical suspension of theoretical assumptions about reality to get back to the \"things themselves\", that is, as originally given in experience. They contend that this base-level of experience provides the foundation for higher-order theoretical knowledge, and that one needs to understand the former to understand the latter.[34]\nAn early approach found in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy is that philosophy is the spiritual practice of developing one\'s rational capacities.[35] This practice is an expression of the philosopher\'s love of wisdom and has the aim of improving one\'s well-being by leading a reflective life.[36] For example, the Stoics saw philosophy as an exercise to train the mind and thereby achieve eudaimonia and flourish in life.[37]\n\nHistory \nMain article: History of philosophy\nAs a discipline, the history of philosophy aims to provide a systematic and chronological exposition of philosophical concepts and doctrines.[38] Some theorists see it as a part of intellectual history, but it also investigates questions not covered by intellectual history such as whether the theories of past philosophers are true and have remained philosophically relevant.[39] The history of philosophy is primarily concerned with theories based on rational inquiry and argumentation; some historians understand it in a looser sense that includes myths, religious teachings, and proverbial lore.[40]\nInfluential traditions in the history of philosophy include Western, Arabicâ€“Persian, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. Other philosophical traditions are Japanese philosophy, Latin American philosophy, and African philosophy.[41]\n\nWestern\nMain article: Western philosophy\nAristotle was a major figure in ancient philosophy and developed a comprehensive system of thought including metaphysics, logic, ethics, politics, and natural science.[42]\nWestern philosophy originated in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE with the pre-Socratics. They attempted to provide rational explanations of the cosmos as a whole.[43] The philosophy following them was shaped by Socrates (469â€“399 BCE), Plato (427â€“347 BCE), and Aristotle (384â€“322 BCE). They expanded the range of topics to questions like how people should act, how to arrive at knowledge, and what the nature of reality and mind is.[44] The later part of the ancient period was marked by the emergence of philosophical movements, for example, Epicureanism, Stoicism, Skepticism, and Neoplatonism.[45] The medieval period started in the 5th century CE. Its focus was on religious topics and many thinkers used ancient philosophy to explain and further elaborate Christian doctrines.[46][47]\nThe Renaissance period started in the 14th century and saw a renewed interest in schools of ancient philosophy, in particular Platonism. Humanism also emerged in this period.[48] The modern period started in the 17th century. One of its central concerns was how philosophical and scientific knowledge are created. Specific importance was given to the role of reason and sensory experience.[49] Many of these innovations were used in the Enlightenment movement to challenge traditional authorities.[50] Several attempts to develop comprehensive systems of philosophy were made in the 19th century, for instance, by German idealism and Marxism.[51] Influential developments in 20th-century philosophy were the emergence and application of formal logic, the focus on the role of language as well as pragmatism, and movements in continental philosophy like phenomenology, existentialism, and post-structuralism.[52] The 20th century saw a rapid expansion of academic philosophy in terms of the number of philosophical publications and philosophers working at academic institutions.[53] There was also a noticeable growth in the number of female philosophers, but they still remained underrepresented.[54]\n\nArabicâ€“Persian\nMain articles: Islamic philosophy and Iranian philosophy\nPortrait of Avicenna on a silver vase. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the Islamic Golden Age.\nArabicâ€“Persian philosophy arose in the early 9th century CE as a response to discussions in the Islamic theological tradition. Its classical period lasted until the 12th century CE and was strongly influenced by ancient Greek philosophers. It employed their ideas to elaborate and interpret the teachings of the Quran.[55]\nAl-Kindi (801â€“873 CE) is usually regarded as the first philosopher of this tradition. He translated and interpreted many works of Aristotle and Neoplatonists in his attempt to show that there is a harmony between reason and faith.[56] Avicenna (980â€“1037 CE) also followed this goal and developed a comprehensive philosophical system to provide a rational understanding of reality encompassing science, religion, and mysticism.[57] Al-Ghazali (1058â€“1111 CE) was a strong critic of the idea that reason can arrive at a true understanding of reality and God. He formulated a detailed critique of philosophy and tried to assign philosophy a more limited place besides the teachings of the Quran and mystical insight.[58] Following Al-Ghazali and the end of the classical period, the influence of philosophical inquiry waned.[59] Mulla Sadra (1571â€“1636 CE) is often regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the subsequent period.[60] The increasing influence of Western thought and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries gave rise to the intellectual movement of Islamic modernism, which aims to understand the relation between traditional Islamic beliefs and modernity.[61]\n\nIndian\nMain article: Indian philosophy\nOne of the distinguishing features of Indian philosophy is that it integrates the exploration of the nature of reality, the ways of arriving at knowledge, and the spiritual question of how to reach enlightenment.[62] It started around 900 BCE when the Vedas were written. They are the foundational scriptures of Hinduism and contemplate issues concerning the relation between the self and ultimate reality as well as the question of how souls are reborn based on their past actions.[63] This period also saw the emergence of non-Vedic teachings, like Buddhism and Jainism.[64] Buddhism was founded by Gautama Siddhartha (563â€“483 BCE), who challenged the Vedic idea of a permanent self and proposed a path to liberate oneself from suffering.[64] Jainism was founded by Mahavira (599â€“527 BCE), who emphasized non-violence as well as respect toward all forms of life.[65]\nThe subsequent classical period started roughly 200 BCE[b] and was characterized by the emergence of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism: NyÄyÃ¡, VaiÅ›eá¹£ika, SÄá¹ƒkhya, Yoga, MÄ«mÄá¹ƒsÄ, and Vedanta.[67] The school of Advaita Vedanta developed later in this period. It was systematized by Adi Shankara (c.â€‰700â€“750 CE), who held that everything is one and that the impression of a universe consisting of many distinct entities is an illusion.[68] A slightly different perspective was defended by Ramanuja (1017â€“1137 CE),[c] who founded the school of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and argued that individual entities are real as aspects or parts of the underlying unity.[70] He also helped to popularize the Bhakti movement, which taught devotion toward the divine as a spiritual path and lasted until the 17th to 18th centuries CE.[71] The modern period began roughly 1800 CE and was shaped by encounters with Western thought.[72] Philosophers tried to formulate comprehensive systems to harmonize diverse philosophical and religious teachings. For example, Swami Vivekananda (1863â€“1902 CE) used the teachings of Advaita Vedanta to argue that all the different religions are valid paths toward the one divine.[73]\n\nChinese\nMain article: Chinese philosophy\nThe teachings of Confucius on ethics and society shaped subsequent Chinese philosophy.\nChinese philosophy is particularly interested in practical questions associated with right social conduct, government, and self-cultivation.[74] Many schools of thought emerged in the 6th century BCE in competing attempts to resolve the political turbulence of that period. The most prominent among them were Confucianism and Daoism.[75] Confucianism was founded by Confucius (551â€“479 BCE). It focused on different forms of moral virtues and explored how they lead to harmony in society.[76] Daoism was founded by Laozi (6th century BCE) and examined how humans can live in harmony with nature by following the Dao or the natural order of the universe.[77] Other influential early schools of thought were Mohism, which developed an early form of altruistic consequentialism,[78] and Legalism, which emphasized the importance of a strong state and strict laws.[79]\nBuddhism was introduced to China in the 1st century CE and diversified into new forms of Buddhism.[80] Starting in the 3rd century CE, the school of Xuanxue emerged. It interpreted earlier Daoist works with a specific emphasis on metaphysical explanations.[80] Neo-Confucianism developed in the 11th century CE. It systematized previous Confucian teachings and sought a metaphysical foundation of ethics.[81] The modern period in Chinese philosophy began in the early 20th century and was shaped by the influence of and reactions to Western philosophy. The emergence of Chinese Marxismâ€”which focused on class struggle, socialism, and communismâ€”resulted in a significant transformation of the political landscape.[82] Another development was the emergence of New Confucianism, which aims to modernize and rethink Confucian teachings to explore their compatibility with democratic ideals and modern science.[83]\n\nOther traditions\nTraditional Japanese philosophy assimilated and synthesized ideas from different traditions, including the indigenous Shinto religion and Chinese and Indian thought in the forms of Confucianism and Buddhism, both of which entered Japan in the 6th and 7th centuries. Its practice is characterized by active interaction with reality rather than disengaged examination.[84] Neo-Confucianism became an influential school of thought in the 16th century and the following Edo period and prompted a greater focus on language and the natural world.[85] The Kyoto School emerged in the 20th century and integrated Eastern spirituality with Western philosophy in its exploration of concepts like absolute nothingness (zettai-mu), place (basho), and the self.[86]\nLatin American philosophy in the pre-colonial period was practiced by indigenous civilizations and explored questions concerning the nature of reality and the role of humans.[87] It has similarities to indigenous North American philosophy, which covered themes such as the interconnectedness of all things.[88] Latin American philosophy during the colonial period, starting around 1550, was dominated by religious philosophy in the form of scholasticism. Influential topics in the post-colonial period were positivism, the philosophy of liberation, and the exploration of identity and culture.[89]\nEarly African philosophy, like Ubuntu philosophy, was focused on community, morality, and ancestral ideas.[90] Systematic African philosophy emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. It discusses topics such as ethnophilosophy, nÃ©gritude, pan-Africanism, Marxism, postcolonialism, the role of cultural identity, and the critique of Eurocentrism.[91]\n\nCore branches\nSee also: Outline of philosophy Â§ Branches of philosophy, and Outline of philosophy Â§ Philosophical schools of thought\nPhilosophical questions can be grouped into several branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. Epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics are sometimes listed as the main branches.[92] There are many other subfields besides them and the different divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. For example, political philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics are sometimes linked under the general heading of value theory as they investigate normative or evaluative aspects.[93] Furthermore, philosophical inquiry sometimes overlaps with other disciplines in the natural and social sciences, religion, and mathematics.[94]\n\nEpistemology\nMain article: Epistemology\nEpistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge. It is also known as theory of knowledge and aims to understand what knowledge is, how it arises, what its limits are, and what value it has. It further examines the nature of truth, belief, justification, and rationality.[95] Some of the questions addressed by epistemologists include \"By what method(s) can one acquire knowledge?\"; \"How is truth established?\"; and \"Can we prove causal relations?\"[96]\nEpistemology is primarily interested in declarative knowledge or knowledge of facts, like knowing that Princess Diana died in 1997. But it also investigates practical knowledge, such as knowing how to ride a bicycle, and knowledge by acquaintance, for example, knowing a celebrity personally.[97]\nOne area in epistemology is the analysis of knowledge. It assumes that declarative knowledge is a combination of different parts and attempts to identify what those parts are. An influential theory in this area claims that knowledge has three components: it is a belief that is justified and true. This theory is controversial and the difficulties associated with it are known as the Gettier problem.[98] Alternative views state that knowledge requires additional components, like the absence of luck; different components, like the manifestation of cognitive virtues instead of justification; or they deny that knowledge can be analyzed in terms of other phenomena.[99]\nAnother area in epistemology asks how people acquire knowledge. Often-discussed sources of knowledge are perception, introspection, memory, inference, and testimony.[100] According to empiricists, all knowledge is based on some form of experience. Rationalists reject this view and hold that some forms of knowledge, like innate knowledge, are not acquired through experience.[101] The regress problem is a common issue in relation to the sources of knowledge and the justification they offer. It is based on the idea that beliefs require some kind of reason or evidence to be justified. The problem is that the source of justification may itself be in need of another source of justification. This leads to an infinite regress or circular reasoning. Foundationalists avoid this conclusion by arguing that some sources can provide justification without requiring justification themselves.[102] Another solution is presented by coherentists, who state that a belief is justified if it coheres with other beliefs of the person.[103]\nMany discussions in epistemology touch on the topic of philosophical skepticism, which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge. These doubts are often based on the idea that knowledge requires absolute certainty and that humans are unable to acquire it.[104]\n\nEthics\nMain article: Ethics\n\"The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end.\" â€” John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism (1863)[105]\nEthics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes right conduct. It is also concerned with the moral evaluation of character traits and institutions. It explores what the standards of morality are and how to live a good life.[106] Philosophical ethics addresses such basic questions as \"Are moral obligations relative?\"; \"Which has priority: well-being or obligation?\"; and \"What gives life meaning?\"[107]\nThe main branches of ethics are meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.[108] Meta-ethics asks abstract questions about the nature and sources of morality. It analyzes the meaning of ethical concepts, like right action and obligation. It also investigates whether ethical theories can be true in an absolute sense and how to acquire knowledge of them.[109] Normative ethics encompasses general theories of how to distinguish between right and wrong conduct. It helps guide moral decisions by examining what moral obligations and rights people have. Applied ethics studies the consequences of the general theories developed by normative ethics in specific situations, for example, in the workplace or for medical treatments.[110]\nWithin contemporary normative ethics, consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics are influential schools of thought.[111] Consequentialists judge actions based on their consequences. One such view is utilitarianism, which argues that actions should increase overall happiness while minimizing suffering. Deontologists judge actions based on whether they follow moral duties, such as abstaining from lying or killing. According to them, what matters is that actions are in tune with those duties and not what consequences they have. Virtue theorists judge actions based on how the moral character of the agent is expressed. According to this view, actions should conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do by manifesting virtues like generosity and honesty.[112]\n\nLogic\nMain article: Logic\nLogic is the study of correct reasoning. It aims to understand how to distinguish good from bad arguments.[113] It is usually divided into formal and informal logic. Formal logic uses artificial languages with a precise symbolic representation to investigate arguments. In its search for exact criteria, it examines the structure of arguments to determine whether they are correct or incorrect. Informal logic uses non-formal criteria and standards to assess the correctness of arguments. It relies on additional factors such as content and context.[114]\nLogic examines a variety of arguments. Deductive arguments are mainly studied by formal logic. An argument is deductively valid if the truth of its premises ensures the truth of its conclusion. Deductively valid arguments follow a rule of inference, like modus ponens, which has the following logical form: \"p; if p then q; therefore q\". An example is the argument \"today is Sunday; if today is Sunday then I don\'t have to go to work today; therefore I don\'t have to go to work today\".[115]\nThe premises of non-deductive arguments also support their conclusion, although this support does not guarantee that the conclusion is true.[116] One form is inductive reasoning. It starts from a set of individual cases and uses generalization to arrive at a universal law governing all cases. An example is the inference that \"all ravens are black\" based on observations of many individual black ravens.[117] Another form is abductive reasoning. It starts from an observation and concludes that the best explanation of this observation must be true. This happens, for example, when a doctor diagnoses a disease based on the observed symptoms.[118]\nLogic also investigates incorrect forms of reasoning. They are called fallacies and are divided into formal and informal fallacies based on whether the source of the error lies only in the form of the argument or also in its content and context.[119]\n\nMetaphysics\nMain article: Metaphysics\nThe beginning of Aristotle\'s Metaphysics in an incunabulum decorated with hand-painted miniatures.\nMetaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, space and time, events, and causation.[120] There are disagreements about the precise definition of the term and its meaning has changed throughout the ages.[121] Metaphysicians attempt to answer basic questions including \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\"; \"Of what does reality ultimately consist?\"; and \"Are humans free?\"[122]\nMetaphysics is sometimes divided into general metaphysics and specific or special metaphysics. General metaphysics investigates being as such. It examines the features that all entities have in common. Specific metaphysics is interested in different kinds of being, the features they have, and how they differ from one another.[123]\nAn important area in metaphysics is ontology. Some theorists identify it with general metaphysics. Ontology investigates concepts like being, becoming, and reality. It studies the categories of being and asks what exists on the most fundamental level.[124] Another subfield of metaphysics is philosophical cosmology. It is interested in the essence of the world as a whole. It asks questions including whether the universe has a beginning and an end and whether it was created by something else.[125]\nA key topic in metaphysics concerns the question of whether reality only consists of physical things like matter and energy. Alternative suggestions are that mental entities (such as souls and experiences) and abstract entities (such as numbers) exist apart from physical things. Another topic in metaphysics concerns the problem of identity. One question is how much an entity can change while still remaining the same entity.[126] According to one view, entities have essential and accidental features. They can change their accidental features but they cease to be the same entity if they lose an essential feature.[127] A central distinction in metaphysics is between particulars and universals. Universals, like the color red, can exist at different locations at the same time. This is not the case for particulars including individual persons or specific objects.[128] Other metaphysical questions are whether the past fully determines the present and what implications this would have for the existence of free will.[129]\n\nOther major branches\nSee also: List of philosophies\nThere are many other subfields of philosophy besides its core branches. Some of the most prominent are aesthetics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, and political philosophy.[130]\nAesthetics in the philosophical sense is the field that studies the nature and appreciation of beauty and other aesthetic properties, like the sublime.[131] Although it is often treated together with the philosophy of art, aesthetics is a broader category that encompasses other aspects of experience, such as natural beauty.[132] In a more general sense, aesthetics is \"critical reflection on art, culture, and nature\".[133] A key question in aesthetics is whether beauty is an objective feature of entities or a subjective aspect of experience.[134] Aesthetic philosophers also investigate the nature of aesthetic experiences and judgments. Further topics include the essence of works of art and the processes involved in creating them.[135]\nThe philosophy of language studies the nature and function of language. It examines the concepts of meaning, reference, and truth. It aims to answer questions such as how words are related to things and how language affects human thought and understanding. It is closely related to the disciplines of logic and linguistics.[136] The philosophy of language rose to particular prominence in the early 20th century in analytic philosophy due to the works of Frege and Russell. One of its central topics is to understand how sentences get their meaning. There are two broad theoretical camps: those emphasizing the formal truth conditions of sentences[d] and those investigating circumstances that determine when it is suitable to use a sentence, the latter of which is associated with speech act theory.[138]\nThe philosophy of mind studies the nature of mental phenomena and how they are related to the physical world.[139] It aims to understand different types of conscious and unconscious mental states, like beliefs, desires, intentions, feelings, sensations, and free will.[140] An influential intuition in the philosophy of mind is that there is a distinction between the inner experience of objects and their existence in the external world. The mind-body problem is the problem of explaining how these two types of thingâ€”mind and matterâ€”are related. The main traditional responses are materialism, which assumes that matter is more fundamental; idealism, which assumes that mind is more fundamental; and dualism, which assumes that mind and matter are distinct types of entities. In contemporary philosophy, another common view is functionalism, which understands mental states in terms of the functional or causal roles they play.[141] The mind-body problem is closely related to the hard problem of consciousness, which asks how the physical brain can produce qualitatively subjective experiences.[142]\nThe philosophy of religion investigates the basic concepts, assumptions, and arguments associated with religion. It critically reflects on what religion is, how to define the divine, and whether one or more gods exist. It also includes the discussion of worldviews that reject religious doctrines.[143] Further questions addressed by the philosophy of religion are: \"How are we to interpret religious language, if not literally?\";[144] \"Is divine omniscience compatible with free will?\";[145] and, \"Are the great variety of world religions in some way compatible in spite of their apparently contradictory theological claims?\"[146] It includes topics from nearly all branches of philosophy.[147] It differs from theology since theological debates typically take place within one religious tradition, whereas debates in the philosophy of religion transcend any particular set of theological assumptions.[148]\nThe philosophy of science examines the fundamental concepts, assumptions, and problems associated with science. It reflects on what science is and how to distinguish it from pseudoscience. It investigates the methods employed by scientists, how their application can result in knowledge, and on what assumptions they are based. It also studies the purpose and implications of science.[149] Some of its questions are \"What counts as an adequate explanation?\";[150] \"Is a scientific law anything more than a description of a regularity?\";[151] and \"Can some special sciences be explained entirely in the terms of a more general science?\"[152] It is a vast field that is commonly divided into the philosophy of the natural sciences and the philosophy of the social sciences, with further subdivisions for each of the individual sciences under these headings. How these branches are related to one another is also a question in the philosophy of science. Many of its philosophical issues overlap with the fields of metaphysics or epistemology.[153]\nPolitical philosophy is the philosophical inquiry into the fundamental principles and ideas governing political systems and societies. It examines the basic concepts, assumptions, and arguments in the field of politics. It investigates the nature and purpose of government and compares its different forms.[154] It further asks under what circumstances the use of political power is legitimate, rather than a form of simple violence.[155] In this regard, it is concerned with the distribution of political power, social and material goods, and legal rights.[156] Other topics are justice, liberty, equality, sovereignty, and nationalism.[157] Political philosophy involves a general inquiry into normative matters and differs in this respect from political science, which aims to provide empirical descriptions of actually existing states.[158] Political philosophy is often treated as a subfield of ethics.[159] Influential schools of thought in political philosophy are liberalism, conservativism, socialism, and anarchism.[160]\n\nMethods\nMain article: Philosophical methodology\nMethods of philosophy are ways of conducting philosophical inquiry. They include techniques for arriving at philosophical knowledge and justifying philosophical claims as well as principles used for choosing between competing theories.[161] A great variety of methods have been employed throughout the history of philosophy. Many of them differ significantly from the methods used in the natural sciences in that they do not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment.[162] The choice of one\'s method usually has important implications both for how philosophical theories are constructed and for the arguments cited for or against them.[163] This choice is often guided by epistemological considerations about what constitutes philosophical evidence.[164]\nMethodological disagreements can cause conflicts among philosophical theories or about the answers to philosophical questions. The discovery of new methods has often had important consequences both for how philosophers conduct their research and for what claims they defend.[165] Some philosophers engage in most of their theorizing using one particular method while others employ a wider range of methods based on which one fits the specific problem investigated best.[166]\nConceptual analysis is a common method in analytic philosophy. It aims to clarify the meaning of concepts by analyzing them into their component parts.[167] Another method often employed in analytic philosophy is based on common sense. It starts with commonly accepted beliefs and tries to draw unexpected conclusions from them, which it often employs in a negative sense to criticize philosophical theories that are too far removed from how the average person sees the issue.[168] It is similar to how ordinary language philosophy approaches philosophical questions by investigating how ordinary language is used.[169]\n\nThe trolley problem is a thought experiment that investigates the moral difference between doing and allowing harm. This issue is explored in an imaginary situation in which a person can sacrifice a single person by redirecting a trolley to save a group of people.[170]\nVarious methods in philosophy give particular importance to intuitions, that is, non-inferential impressions about the correctness of specific claims or general principles.[171] For example, they play an important role in thought experiments, which employ counterfactual thinking to evaluate the possible consequences of an imagined situation. These anticipated consequences can then be used to confirm or refute philosophical theories.[172] The method of reflective equilibrium also employs intuitions. It seeks to form a coherent position on a certain issue by examining all the relevant beliefs and intuitions, some of which often have to be deemphasized or reformulated to arrive at a coherent perspective.[173]\nPragmatists stress the significance of concrete practical consequences for assessing whether a philosophical theory is true.[174] According to the pragmatic maxim as formulated by Charles Sanders Peirce, the idea a person has of an object is nothing more than the totality of practical consequences they associate with this object. Pragmatists have also used this method to expose disagreements as merely verbal, that is, to show they make no genuine difference on the level of consequences.[175]\nPhenomenologists seek knowledge of the realm of appearance and the structure of human experience. They insist upon the first-personal character of all experience and proceed by suspending theoretical judgments about the external world. This technique of phenomenological reduction is known as \"bracketing\" or epochÃ©. The goal is to give an unbiased description of the appearances of things.[176]\nMethodological naturalism places great emphasis on the empirical approach and the resulting theories found in the natural sciences. In this way, it contrasts with methodologies that give more weight to pure reasoning and introspection.[177]\n\nRelation to other fields\nPhilosophy is closely related to many other fields. It is sometimes understood as a metadiscipline that clarifies their nature and limits. It does this by critically examining their basic concepts, background assumptions, and methods. In this regard, it plays a key role in providing an interdisciplinary perspective. It bridges the gap between different disciplines by analyzing which concepts and problems they have in common. It shows how they overlap while also delimiting their scope.[178] Historically, most of the individual sciences originated from philosophy.[179]\nThe influence of philosophy is felt in several fields that require difficult practical decisions. In medicine, philosophical considerations related to bioethics affect issues like whether an embryo is already a person and under what conditions abortion is morally permissible. A closely related philosophical problem is how humans should treat other animals, for instance, whether it is acceptable to use non-human animals as food or for research experiments.[180] In relation to business and professional life, philosophy has contributed by providing ethical frameworks. They contain guidelines on which business practices are morally acceptable and cover the issue of corporate social responsibility.[181]\nPhilosophical inquiry is relevant to many fields that are concerned with what to believe and how to arrive at evidence for one\'s beliefs.[182] This is a key issue for the sciences, which have as one of their prime objectives the creation of scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence but it is often not clear whether empirical observations are neutral or already include theoretical assumptions. A closely connected problem is whether the available evidence is sufficient to decide between competing theories.[183] Epistemological problems in relation to the law include what counts as evidence and how much evidence is required to find a person guilty of a crime. A related issue in journalism is how to ensure truth and objectivity when reporting on events.[178]\nIn the fields of theology and religion, there are many doctrines associated with the existence and nature of God as well as rules governing correct behavior. A key issue is whether a rational person should believe these doctrines, for example, whether revelation in the form of holy books and religious experiences of the divine are sufficient evidence for these beliefs.[184]\n\nJudith Butler is one of the philosophers responsible for the cultural influence of philosophy on the feminist movement.\nPhilosophy in the form of logic has been influential in the fields of mathematics and computer science.[185] Further fields influenced by philosophy include psychology, sociology, linguistics, education, and the arts.[186] The close relation between philosophy and other fields in the contemporary period is reflected in the fact that many philosophy graduates go on to work in related fields rather than in philosophy itself.[187]\nIn the field of politics, philosophy addresses issues such as how to assess whether a government policy is just.[188] Philosophical ideas have prepared and shaped various political developments. For example, ideals formulated in Enlightenment philosophy laid the foundation for constitutional democracy and played a role in the American Revolution and the French Revolution.[189] Marxist philosophy and its exposition of communism was one of the factors in the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Communist Revolution.[190] In India, Mahatma Gandhi\'s philosophy of non-violence shaped the Indian independence movement.[191]\nAn example of the cultural and critical role of philosophy is found in its influence on the feminist movement through philosophers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Simone de Beauvoir, and Judith Butler. It has shaped the understanding of key concepts in feminism, for instance, the meaning of gender, how it differs from biological sex, and what role it plays in the formation of personal identity. Philosophers have also investigated the concepts of justice and equality and their implications with respect to the prejudicial treatment of women in male-dominated societies.[192]\nThe idea that philosophy is useful for many aspects of life and society is sometimes rejected. According to one such view, philosophy is mainly undertaken for its own sake and does not make significant contributions to existing practices or external goals.[193]\n\nSee also\nMain article: Outline of philosophy\n\nPhilosophy portal\n\nList of important publications in philosophy\nList of philosophical problems\nList of philosophy awards\nList of philosophy journals\nList of years in philosophy\nLists of philosophers\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\n\n^ The Ancient Greek philosophos (\'philosopher\') was itself possibly borrowed from the Ancient Egyptian term mer-rekh (mr-rá¸«) meaning \'lover of wisdom\'.[3]\n\n^ The exact periodization is disputed with some sources suggesting it started as early as 500 BCE, while others argue it began as late as 200 CE.[66]\n\n^ These dates are traditionally cited but some recent scholars suggest that his life ran from 1077 to 1157.[69]\n\n^ The truth conditions of a sentence are the circumstances or states of affairs under which the sentence would be true.[137]\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n^ Pratt 2023, p. 169MorujÃ£o, Dimas & Relvas 2021, p. 105Mitias 2022, p. 3\n\n^ Hoad 1993, p. 350Simpson 2002, PhilosophyJacobs 2022, p. 23\n\n^ HerbjÃ¸rnsrud 2021, p. 123HerbjÃ¸rnsrud 2023, p. X\n\n^ Bottin 1993, p. 151JaroszyÅ„ski 2018, p. 12\n\n^ OED staff 2022, Philosophy, n.Hoad 1993, p. 350\n\n^ Ten 1999, p. 9Tuomela 1985, p. 1Grant 2007, p. 303\n\n^ Kenny 2018, p. 189Grant 2007, p. 163Cotterell 2017, p. 458Maddy 2022, p. 24\n\n^ Grant 2007, p. 318Ten 1999, p. 9\n\n^ Cotterell 2017, p. 458Maddy 2022, p. 24Regenbogen 2010, Philosophiebegriffe\n\n^ Grayling 2019, Philosophy in the Nineteenth CenturyRegenbogen 2010Ten 1999, p. 9AHD Staff 2022\n\n^ Audi 2006, Lead Section, Â§ ConclusionQuinton 2005, p. 702Regenbogen 2010, PhilosophiebegriffeEB Staff 2023aOUP Staff 2020Adler 2000\n\n^ Perry, Bratman & Fischer 2010, p. 4.\n\n^ Russell 1912, p. 91Blackwell 2013, p. 148Pojman 2009, p. 2Kenny 2004, p. xvVintiadis 2020, p. 137\n\n^ Plato 2023, Apology.\n\n^ McCutcheon 2014, p. 26.\n\n^ Russell 1912, p. 91Blackwell 2013, p. 148\n\n^ Quinton 2005, p. 702Regenbogen 2010, Philosophiebegriffe\n\n^ Overgaard, Gilbert & Burwood 2013, pp. vii, 17.\n\n^ Overgaard, Gilbert & Burwood 2013, pp. 20, 44, What Is Philosophy?MittelstraÃŸ 2005, Philosophie\n\n^ JollOvergaard, Gilbert & Burwood 2013, pp. 20â€“21, 25, 35, 39, What Is Philosophy?\n\n^ Overgaard, Gilbert & Burwood 2013, pp. 20â€“22, What Is Philosophy?Rescher 2013, pp. 1â€“3, 1.

There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[5]They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[6] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[6] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.\n\nRosa hemisphaerica (syn.: Rosa sulphurea), watercolor by Pierre-Joseph Redouté (1759–1840).\n\nEtymology\nThe name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.[7][8]\n\nBotany\nRose thorns are actually prickles – outgrowths of the epidermis\nRose leaflets\nExterior view of rose buds\nLongitudinal section through a developing rose hip\nThe leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (−13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.\nThe flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which usually have only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[9] Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.\nThe aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 \"seeds\" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.\nThe sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called \"thorns\", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.\n\nEvolution\nThe oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado.[10] Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.[11]\nToday\'s garden roses come from 18th-century China.[12] Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.[13]\n\nSpecies\nMain article: List of Rosa species\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(May 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nBlooming roses at Huntington Library in San Marino, California, United States\nVarious roses at Rose Garden at Huntington Library in San Marino, California\nRosa gallica \'Evêque\', painted by Redouté\nThe genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:[14]\n\nHulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning \"with single leaves\") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.\nHesperrhodos (from the Greek for \"western rose\") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.\nPlatyrhodon (from the Greek for \"flaky rose\", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).\nRosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.\nBanksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.\nBracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.\nCaninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.\nCarolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.\nChinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.\nGallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.\nGymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.\nLaevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.\nPimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.\nRosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.\nSynstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.\nUses\nRoses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.\n\nOrnamental plants\nMain article: Garden roses\nThe majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).\nOrnamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China.[15] It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants.[16] Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.\nIn the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.\n\nCut flowers\nMain article: Cut flowers\nBouquet of pink roses\nRoses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.\nIn temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.[17]\nSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.\n\nPerfume\nFurther information: Rose oil and Rose water\nGeraniol (C10H18O)\nRose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia[18] and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena \'Trigintipetala\') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. \'Rose Absolute\' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.\nThe main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil.[19] β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.\n\nFood and drink\nRosa rubiginosa hips\nFarming of Rosa rugosa\nRose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw,[20] and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.[21]\n\nGulab jamun made with rose water\nRose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight,[22] barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.[20]\nIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.[23][24]\nThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases).[20] The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food.[25] Other minor uses include candied rose petals.[26]\nRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.\nUnder the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,[27] there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).\n\nRose absolute: Rosa alba L., Rosa centifolia L., Rosa damascena Mill., Rosa gallica L., and vars. of these spp.\nRose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto\nRose buds\nRose flowers\nRose fruit (hips)\nRose leaves: Rosa spp.[28]\nAs a food ingredient\nThe rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C.[29] Diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, \"compound of roses\", from ῥόδων, \"of roses\"[30]) is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.\n\nArt and symbolism\nMain article: Rose (symbolism)\nThe long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite.[31][32] In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the \"immortal oil of the rose\"[33][31] and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him \"among rose blossoms\".[34][31] The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood.[35][31] Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.[32] French writer René Rapin invented a myth in which a beautiful Corinthian queen named Rhodanthe (\"she with rose flowers\") was besieged inside a temple of Artemis by three ardent suitors who wished to worship her as a goddess; the god Apollo then transformed her into a rosebush.[36]\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation.[37][38][32] The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.[39][32]\n\nFramed print after 1908 painting by Henry Payne of the scene in the Temple Garden, where supporters of the rival factions in the Wars of the Roses pick either red or white roses Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary.[32] In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens.[32] Albrecht Dürer\'s painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her devotees.[32]\nRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\nRoses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.\nHenri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose \'Fantin-Latour\' was named after the artist.\nOther impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city\'s symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.[40]\nIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose[41] the floral emblem of the United States.[42]\nThe rose is often exchanged on St. Valentines Day and is used often as a symbol of such.[43]\n\n\n\n\nCodex Manesse illuminated with roses, illustrated between 1305 and 1340 in Zürich.

Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.\nCultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.\n\nSee also\nADR rose\nList of Award of Garden Merit roses\nList of rose cultivars named after people\nRose (colour)\nRose garden\nRose Hall of Fame\nRose show\nRose trial grounds\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Rosa\".

Runes were used to write Germanic languages (with some exceptions) before they adopted the Latin alphabet, and for specialised purposes thereafter. In addition to representing a sound value (a phoneme), runes can be used to represent the concepts after which they are named (ideographs). Scholars refer to instances of the latter as Begriffsrunen (\'concept runes\'). The Scandinavian variants are also known as fuÃ¾ark, or futhark, these names derived from the first six letters of the script, âŸ¨áš âŸ©, âŸ¨áš¢âŸ©, âŸ¨áš¦âŸ©, âŸ¨áš¨âŸ©/âŸ¨áš¬âŸ©, âŸ¨áš±âŸ©, and âŸ¨áš²âŸ©/âŸ¨áš´âŸ©, corresponding to the Latin letters âŸ¨fâŸ©, âŸ¨uâŸ©, âŸ¨Ã¾âŸ©/âŸ¨thâŸ©, âŸ¨aâŸ©, âŸ¨râŸ©, and âŸ¨kâŸ©. The Anglo-Saxon variant is futhorc, or fuÃ¾orc, due to changes in Old English of the sounds represented by the fourth letter, âŸ¨áš¨âŸ©/âŸ¨áš©âŸ©.\nRunology is the academic study of the runic alphabets, runic inscriptions, runestones, and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic philology.\nThe earliest secure runic inscriptions date from around AD 150, with a potentially earlier inscription dating to AD 50 and Tacitus\'s potential description of rune use from around AD 98. The Svingerud Runestone dates from between AD 1 to 250. Runes were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation, by approximately AD 700 in central Europe and 1100 in northern Europe. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes beyond this period. Up until the early 20th century, runes were still used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on runic calendars.\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark (c. AD 150â€“800), the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc (400â€“1100), and the Younger Futhark (800â€“1100). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called Danish, although they were also used in Norway, Sweden, and Frisia); short-branch, or RÃ¶k, runes (also called Swedishâ€“Norwegian, although they were also used in Denmark); and the stavlÃ¶sa, or HÃ¤lsinge, runes (staveless runes). The Younger Futhark developed further into the medieval runes (1100â€“1500), and the Dalecarlian runes (c. 1500â€“1800).\nThe exact development of the early runic alphabet remains unclear but the script ultimately stems from the Phoenician alphabet. Early runes may have developed from the Raetic, Venetic, Etruscan, or Old Latin as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy, which would become characteristic of the runes and related scripts in the region.\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest clear inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups, while a \"Gothic hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion. Runes continue to be used in a wide variety of ways in modern popular culture.\n\n\nName[edit]\nEtymology[edit]\nThe inscription on the Einang stone (AD 350â€“400), reading [Ek go]Ã°agastiz runo faihido (\"[I, Go]dguest painted/wrote this runic inscription\"),[3] is the earliest Germanic epigraphic attestation of the term.[4]\nThe name stems from a Proto-Germanic form reconstructed as *rÅ«nÅ, which may be translated as \'secret, mystery; secret conversation; rune\'. It is the source of Gothic rÅ«na (ğ‚ğŒ¿ğŒ½ğŒ°, \'secret, mystery, counsel\'), Old English rÃºn (\'whisper, mystery, secret, rune\'), Old Saxon rÅ«na (\'secret counsel, confidential talk\'), Middle Dutch rÅ«ne (\'id\'), Old High German rÅ«na (\'secret, mystery\'), and Old Norse rÃºn (\'secret, mystery, rune\').[5][6] The earliest Germanic epigraphic attestation is the Primitive Norse rÅ«nÅ (accusative singular), found on the Einang stone (AD 350â€“400) and the Noleby stone (AD 450).[4]\nThe term is related to Proto-Celtic *rÅ«na (\'secret, magic\'), which is attested in Old Irish rÃºn (\'mystery, secret\'), Middle Welsh rin (\'mystery, charm\'), Middle Breton rin (\'secret wisdom\'), and possibly in the ancient Gaulish Cobrunus (< *com-rÅ«nos \'confident\'; cf. Middle Welsh cyfrin, Middle Breton queffrin, Middle Irish comrÃºn \'shared secret, confidence\') and Sacruna (< *sacro-runa \'sacred secret\'), as well as in Lepontic Runatis (< *runo-Ätis \'belonging to the secret\'). However, it is difficult to tell whether they are cognates (linguistic siblings from a common origin), or if the Proto-Germanic form reflects an early borrowing from Celtic.[7][8] Various connections have been proposed with other Indo-European terms (for example: Sanskrit rÃ¡uti à¤°à¥Œà¤¤à¤¿ \'roar\', Latin rÅ«mor \'noise, rumor\'; Ancient Greek erÃ©Å á¼ÏÎ­Ï‰ \'ask\' and ereunÃ¡Å á¼ÏÎµÏ…Î½Î¬Ï‰ \'investigate\'),[9] although linguist Ranko MatasoviÄ‡ finds them difficult to justify for semantic or linguistic reasons.[7] Because of this, some scholars have speculated that the Germanic and Celtic words may have been a shared religious term borrowed from an unknown non-Indo-European language.[4][7]\n\nRelated terms[edit]\nIn early Germanic, a rune could also be referred to as *rÅ«na-stabaz, a compound of *rÅ«nÅ and *stabaz (\'staff; letter\'). It is attested in Old Norse rÃºna-stafr, Old English rÃºn-stÃ¦f, and Old High German rÅ«n-stab.[10] Other Germanic terms derived from *rÅ«nÅ include *runÅn (\'counsellor\'), *rÅ«njan and *ga-rÅ«njan (\'secret, mystery\'), *raunÅ (\'trial, inquiry, experiment\'), *hugi-rÅ«nÅ (\'secret of the mind, magical rune\'), and *halja-rÅ«nÅ (\'witch, sorceress\'; literally \'[possessor of the] Hel-secret\').[11] It is also often part of personal names, including Gothic Runilo (ğ‚ğŒ¿ğŒ½ğŒ¹ğŒ»ğ‰), Frankish RÃºnfrid, Old Norse AlfrÃºn, DagrÃºn, GuÃ°rÃºn, SigrÃºn, ÇªlrÃºn, Old English Ã†lfrÃºn, and Lombardic GoderÅ«na.[9]\nThe Finnish word runo, meaning \'poem\', is an early borrowing from Proto-Germanic,[12] and the source of the term for rune, riimukirjain, meaning \'scratched letter\'.[13] The root may also be found in the Baltic languages, where Lithuanian runoti means both \'to cut (with a knife)\' and \'to speak\'.[14]\nThe Old English form rÃºn survived into the early modern period as roun, which is now obsolete. The modern English rune is a later formation that is partly derived from Late Latin runa, Old Norse rÃºn, and Danish rune.[6]\n\nHistory and use[edit]\nAn inscription using cipher runes, the Elder Futhark, and the Younger Futhark, on the 9th-century RÃ¶k runestone in Sweden\nA Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century Vaksala Runestone in Sweden\nThe runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the 1st or 2nd century AD.[a]  This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic.\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of p; see peorÃ°.)\n\nOrigins[edit]\nMain article: Elder Futhark\nThe formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the Kylver Stone being the first evidence of the futhark ordering as well as of the p rune.\nSpecifically, the Rhaetic alphabet of Bolzano is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes (á›– e, á›‡ Ã¯, á›ƒ j, á›œ Å‹, á›ˆ p) having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.[16] Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the Latin alphabet itself over Rhaetic candidates.[17][18][19] A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the Negau helmet dating to the 2nd century BC.[20] This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, Harigast. Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically Venetic: But since Romans conquered Veneto after 200 BC, and then the Latin alphabet became prominent and Venetic culture diminished in importance, Germanic people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.[21]\nThe angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no horizontal strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood.[22] This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the Latin alphabet used for the Duenos inscription, but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is written rather than carved runes, such as Codex Runicus) also show horizontal strokes.\nThe \"West Germanic hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by West Germanic tribes. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around Jutland (the Vimose inscriptions), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by Scandinavian scholars to be Proto-Norse, are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion.[b]\nIn the early Runic period, differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a Northwest Germanic unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.[c][d] An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by Ãˆ. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic koine\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.[28]\n\nThe Meldorf fibula and Tacitus\'s Germania[edit]\nWith the potential exception of the Meldorf fibula, a possible runic inscription found in Schleswig-Holstein dating to around 50 AD, the earliest reference to runes (and runic divination) may occur in Roman Senator Tacitus\'s ethnographic Germania.[29] Dating from around 98 CE, Tacitus describes the Germanic peoples as utilizing a divination practice involving rune-like inscriptions:\n\nFor divination and casting lots they have the highest possible regard. Their procedure for casting lots is uniform: They break off the branch of a fruit tree and slice into strips; they mark these by certain signs and throw them, as random chance will have it, on to a white cloth. Then a state priest, if the consultation is a public one, or the father of the family, if it is private, prays to the gods and, gazing to the heavens, picks up three separate strips and reads their meaning from the marks scored on them. If the lots forbid an enterprise, there can be no further consultation about it that day; if they allow it, further confirmation by divination is required.[30]\nAs Victoria Symons summarizes, \"If the inscriptions made on the lots that Tacitus refers to are understood to be letters, rather than other kinds of notations or symbols, then they would necessarily have been runes, since no other writing system was available to Germanic tribes at this time.\"[29]\n\nEarly inscriptions[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(December 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nRing of Pietroassa (c.â€‰250â€“400 AD) by Henri Trenk, 1875\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150â€“550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in Elder Futhark, but the set of letter shapes and bindrunes employed is far from standardized. Notably the j, s, and Å‹ runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as p and Ã¯, remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the Kylver Stone (c. 400 AD).\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Funen, Zealand, Jutland (Denmark), and Scania (Sweden). Earlierâ€”but less reliableâ€”artifacts have been found in Meldorf, SÃ¼derdithmarschen [de], in northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the Meldorf fibula, and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nMagical or divinatory use[edit]\nMain article: Runic magic\nBracteate DR BR42 bearing the inscription Alu\nAn illustration of the Gummarp Runestone (500â€“700 AD) from Blekinge, Sweden\nCloseup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century BjÃ¶rketorp Runestone located in Blekinge, Sweden\nThe stanza 157 of HÃ¡vamÃ¡l attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life. In this stanza, Odin recounts a spell:\n\n\n\n\n\nÃat kann ek it tolfta,\nef ek sÃ© Ã¡ trÃ© uppi\nvÃ¡fa virgilnÃ¡,:\nsvÃ¡ ek rÃ­st ok Ã­ rÃºnum fÃ¡k,\nat sÃ¡ gengr gumi\nok mÃ¦lir viÃ° mik.[31]\n\n\n\n\nI know a twelfth one\nif I see up in a tree,\na dangling corpse in a noose,\nI can so carve and colour the runes,\nthat the man walks\nand talks with me.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions found on artifacts give the name of either the craftsman or the proprietor, or sometimes, remain a linguistic mystery. Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as magical signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for divination, there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name rune itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite.[citation needed] The 6th-century BjÃ¶rketorp Runestone warns in Proto-Norse using the word rune in both senses:\n\nHaidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz. Arageu haeramalausz uti az. Weladaude, sa\'z Ã¾at barutz. UÃ¾arba spa.\nI, master of the runes(?) conceal here runes of power. Incessantly (plagued by) maleficence, (doomed to) insidious death (is) he who breaks this (monument). I prophesy destruction / prophecy of destruction.[33]\n\nâ€”â€ŠBjÃ¶rketorp Runestone\nThe same curse and use of the word, rune, is also found on the Stentoften Runestone. There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the Franks Casket (AD 700) panel.\nCharm words, such as auja, laÃ¾u, laukaÊ€, and most commonly, alu,[34] appear on a number of Migration period Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as salusalu and luwatuwa. Further, an inscription on the Gummarp Runestone (500â€“700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.[35]\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although Norse literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: Tacitus\'s 1st-century Germania, Snorri Sturluson\'s 13th-century Ynglinga saga, and Rimbert\'s 9th-century Vita Ansgari.\nThe first source, Tacitus\'s Germania,[36] describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus\' writings.  A second source is the Ynglinga saga, where Granmar, the king of SÃ¶dermanland, goes to Uppsala for the blÃ³t. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long (FÃ©ll honum Ã¾Ã¡ svo spÃ¡nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a blÃ³tspÃ¡nn (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"[37][page needed]\nThe third source is Rimbert\'s Vita Ansgari, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, Anund Uppsale, first brings a Danish fleet to Birka, but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking Birka would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a hlautlein (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson[38] would be used in the same manner as a blÃ³tspÃ¡nn.\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,[39][page needed] but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\nMedieval use[edit]\nCodex Runicus, a vellum manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the Scanian Law, is written entirely in runes.This section does not cite any sources.

(March 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nAs Proto-Germanic evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent diphthongs unique to (or at least prevalent in) Old English.\nSome later runic finds are on monuments (runestones), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the Bryggen inscriptions, were found in Bergen.[40] These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained information of an everyday natureâ€”ranging from name tags, prayers (often in Latin), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane, now in the collection of the British Museum\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the clog almanacs (sometimes called Runic staff, Prim, or Scandinavian calendar) of Sweden and Estonia. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\nRunes in Eddic poetry[edit]\nIn Norse mythology, the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin (Old Norse: reginkunnr). This is attested as early as on the Noleby Runestone from c.â€‰600 AD that reads Runo fahi raginakundo toj[e\'k]a..., meaning \"I prepare the suitable divine rune...\"[41] and in an attestation from the 9th century on the SparlÃ¶sa Runestone, which reads Ok raÃ° runaÊ€ Ã¾aÊ€ rÃ¦gi[n]kundu, meaning \"And interpret the runes of divine origin\".[42] In the Poetic Edda poem HÃ¡vamÃ¡l, Stanza 80, the runes also are described as reginkunnr:\n\n\n\n\n\nÃat er Ã¾Ã¡ reynt,\ner Ã¾Ãº at rÃºnum spyrr\ninum reginkunnum,\nÃ¾eim er gerÃ°u ginnregin\nok fÃ¡Ã°i fimbulÃ¾ulr,\nÃ¾Ã¡ hefir hann bazt, ef hann Ã¾egir.[31]\n\n\n\n\nThat is now proved,\nwhat you asked of the runes,\nof the potent famous ones,\nwhich the great gods made,\nand the mighty sage stained,\nthat it is best for him if he stays silent.[43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poem HÃ¡vamÃ¡l explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, Odin. Stanza 138 describes how Odin received the runes through self-sacrifice:\n\n\n\n\n\nVeit ek at ek hekk vindga meiÃ°i a\nnetr allar nÃ­o,\ngeiri vndaÃ¾r ok gefinn OÃ°ni,\nsialfr sialfom mer,\na Ã¾eim meiÃ¾i, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rÃ³tom renn.\n\n\n\n\nI know that I hung on a windy tree\nnine long nights,\nwounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,\nmyself to myself,\non that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stanza 139, Odin continues:\n\n\n\n\n\nViÃ° hleifi mik seldo ne viÃ¾ hornigi,\nnysta ek niÃ¾r,\nnam ek vp rvnar,\nopandi nam,\nfell ek aptr Ã¾aÃ°an.\n\n\n\n\nNo bread did they give me nor a drink from a horn,\ndownwards I peered;\nI took up the runes,\nscreaming I took them,\nthen I fell back from there.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Poetic Edda poem RÃ­gsÃ¾ula another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans. The poem relates how RÃ­g, identified as Heimdall in the introduction, sired three sonsâ€”Thrall (slave), Churl (freeman), and Jarl (noble)â€”by human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, RÃ­g returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop Olaus Magnus recorded a tradition that a man named Kettil Runske had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\nRunic alphabets[edit]\nElder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries)[edit]\nMain article: Elder Futhark\nDetail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD Golden Horns of Gallehus found on Jutland, now Denmark\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing Proto-Norse, consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an Ã¦tt (Old Norse, meaning \'clan, group\'). The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland, Sweden.\nMost probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. Germanic philologists reconstruct names in Proto-Germanic based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the rune poems and the linked names of the letters of the Gothic alphabet. For example, the letter /a/ was named from the runic letter  called Ansuz. An asterisk before the rune names means that they are unattested reconstructions. The 24 Elder Futhark runes are the following:[45]\n\n\n\nRune\n\nUCS\n\nTrans.\n\nIPA\n\nProto-Germanic name\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\náš \n\nf\n\n/É¸/, /f/\n\n*fehu\n\n\"cattle; wealth\"\n\n\n\náš¢\n\nu\n\n/u(Ë)/\n\n?*Å«ruz\n\n\"aurochs\", Wild ox (or *Ã»ram \"water/slag\"?)\n\n\n\náš¦\n\nÃ¾\n\n/Î¸/, /Ã°/\n\n?*Ã¾urisaz\n\n\"Thurs\" (see JÃ¶tunn) or *Ã¾unraz (\"the god Thunraz\")\n\n\n\náš¨\n\na\n\n/a(Ë)/\n\n*ansuz\n\n\"god\"\n\n\n\náš±\n\nr\n\n/r/\n\n*raidÅ\n\n\"ride, journey\"\n\n\n\náš²\n\nk (c)\n\n/k/\n\n?*kaunan\n\n\"ulcer\"?

It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon (also called Anglo-Frisian) Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in Frisia and later spread to England,[citation needed] while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.[citation needed] Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the Thames scramasax, in the Vienna Codex, in Cotton Otho B.x (Anglo-Saxon rune poem) and on the Ruthwell Cross.\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: áš  feoh, áš¢ ur, áš¦ Ã¾orn, áš© os, áš± rad, áš³ cen, áš· gyfu, áš¹ Æ¿ynn, áš» hÃ¦gl, áš¾ nyd, á› is, á›„ ger, á›‡ eoh, á›ˆ peorÃ°, á›‰ eolh, á›‹ sigel, á› tir, á›’ beorc, á›– eh, á›— mann, á›š lagu, á› ing, á›Ÿ Å“thel, á› dÃ¦g, ášª ac, áš« Ã¦sc, áš£ yr, á›¡ ior, á›  ear.\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include á›¢ cweorÃ°, á›£ calc, áš¸ gar, and á›¥ stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in manuscripts. Feoh, Ã¾orn, and sigel stood for [f], [Î¸], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [Ã°], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters yogh and wynn, which became [g] and [w] in Middle English.\n\n\"Marcomannic runes\" (8th to 9th centuries)[edit]\nMarcomannic runes\nA runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called De Inventione Litterarum, ascribed to Hrabanus Maurus and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the Carolingian Empire (Alemannia, Bavaria). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus, and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the Marcomanni, and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\nWilhelm Grimm discussed these runes in 1821.[48]\n\nYounger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)[edit]\nMain article: Younger Futhark\nThe Younger Futhark: long-branch runes and short-twig runes\nWhile also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century Ramsung carving is a Sigurd stone that depicts the legend of Sigurd.\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse. They are found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\nMedieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)[edit]\nMain article: Medieval runes\nMedieval runes\nA church bell from Saleby, VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland, Sweden, including a runic inscription from 1228 AD\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the Old Norse language. Dotted variants of voiceless signs were introduced to denote the corresponding voiced consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as s, c, and z often were used interchangeably.[49][50]\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in Bergen since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called Bryggen inscriptions). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin.\n\nDalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries)[edit]\nMain article: Dalecarlian runes\nDalecarlian runes\nAccording to Carl-Gustav Werner, \"In the isolated province of Dalarna in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.\"[51]  The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century.[52] Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing Swedish in areas where Elfdalian was predominant.\n\nDifferences from Roman script[edit]\nWhile Roman script would ultimately replace runes in most contexts, it differed significantly from runic script. For example, on the differences between the use of Anglo-Saxon runes and the Latin script that would come to replace them, runologist Victoria Symons says:\n\nAs well as being distinguished from the roman alphabet in visual appearance and letter order, the fuÃ¾orc is further set apart by the fact that, unlike their roman counterparts, runic letters are often associated not only with sound values but also with names. These names are often nouns and, in almost all instances, they begin with the sound value represented by the associated letter. ... The fact that each rune represents [both] a sound value and a word gives this writing system a multivalent quality that further distinguishes it from roman script. A roman letter simply represents its sound value. When used, for example, for the purpose of pagination, such letters can assume added significance, but this is localised to the context of an individual manuscript. Runic letters, on the other hand, are inherently multivalent; they can, and often do, represent several different kinds of information simultaneously. This aspect of runic letters is one that is frequently employed and exploited by writers and scribes who include them in their manuscripts.[53]\nUse as ideographs (Begriffsrunen)[edit]\nIn addition to their historic use as letters in the runic alphabets, runes were also used to represent their names (ideographs). Such instances are sometimes referred to by way of the modern German loan word Begriffsrunen, meaning \'concept-runes\' (singular Begriffsrune). The criteria for the use of Begriffsrunen and the frequency of their use by ancient rune-writers remains controversial.[54] The topic of Begriffsrunen has produced much discussion among runologists. Runologist Klaus DÃ¼wel has proposed two criteria for the identification of runes as Begriffsrunen: A graphic argument and a semantic argument.[54]\nExamples of Begriffsrunen (or potential Begriffsrunen) include the following:\n\n\n\nInscription\n\nDate\n\nScript\n\nLanguage\n\nRune\n\nNotes\n\n\nLindholm amulet\n\n2nd to 4th centuries\n\nElder Futhark\n\nProto-Norse\n\nSeveral different runes\n\nIn this inscription, several runes repeat in a sentence to form an unknown meaning. Various scholars have proposed that these runes represent repeated Begriffsrunen.\n\n\nRing of Pietroassa\n\n250â€“400 AD\n\nElder Futhark\n\nGothic\n\nOdal (rune)\n\nThis object was cut by thieves, damaging one of the runes. The identity of this rune was debated by scholars until a photograph of it was republished that, according to runologist Bernard Mees, clearly indicates it to have been Odal (rune).[55]\n\n\nStentoften Runestone\n\n500â€“700 AD\n\nElder Futhark\n\nProto-Norse\n\nJÄ“ran\n\nThis inscription is commonly cited as containing a Begriffsrune.[54]\n\nIn addition to the instances above, several different runes occur as ideographs in Old English and Old Norse manuscripts (featuring Anglo-Saxon runes and Younger Futhark runes respectively). Runologist Thomas Birkett summarizes these numerous instances as follows:\n\nThe maÃ°r rune is found regularly in Icelandic manuscripts, the fÃ© rune somewhat less frequently, whilst in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts the runes mon, dÃ¦g, wynn and eÃ¾el are all used on occasion. These are some of the most functional of the rune names, occurring relatively often in written language, unlike the elusive peorÃ°, for example, which would be of little or no use as an abbreviation because of its rarity. The practicality of using an abbreviation for a familiar noun such as \'man\' is demonstrated clearly in the Old Norse poem HÃ¡vamÃ¡l, where the maÃ°r rune is used a total of forty-five times, saving a significant amount of space and effort (Codex Regius: 5â€“14)[56]\nAcademic study[edit]\nMain article: Runology\nThe modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by Johannes Bureus (1568â€“1652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a kabbalistic sense. The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck Sr (1630â€“1702) and presented in his collection Atlantica. Anders Celsius (1701â€“1744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the runstenar.  From the  \"golden age of philology\" in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics.\n\nBody of inscriptions[edit]\nMain article: Runic inscriptions\nThe Vimose Comb from the island of Funen, Denmark, features the earliest known runic inscription (AD 150 to 200) and simply reads, ášºáš¨áš±á›ƒáš¨ \"Harja\", a male name.[57]\nThe largest group of surviving Runic inscription are Viking Age Younger Futhark runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden.[58] Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, more than 650 in total. Elder Futhark inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on bracteates. Anglo-Saxon futhorc inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\nModern use[edit]\nMain article: Modern runic writing\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century Viking revival, in Scandinavian Romantic nationalism (Gothicismus) and Germanic occultism in the 19th century, and in the context of the Fantasy genre and of modern Germanic paganism in the 20th century.[citation needed]\n\nEsotericism[edit]\nGermanic mysticism and Nazi Germany[edit]\nFurther information: Armanen runes, Wiligut runes, and Runengymnastik\nRunic script on an 1886 gravestone in Parkend, England\nFrom 1933, the Schutzstaffel unit insignia comprised two sig runes, which derive from the Armanen Futhark, invented in the 19th century by vÃ¶lkisch author Guido von List.\nThe pioneer of the Armanist branch of Ariosophy and one of the more important figures in esotericism in Germany and Austria in the late 19th and early 20th century was the Austrian occultist, mysticist, and vÃ¶lkisch author, Guido von List. In 1908, he published in Das Geheimnis der Runen (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"Armanen runes\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List\'s own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902. The use of runes in Germanic mysticism, notably List\'s \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"Wiligut runes\" by Karl Maria Wiligut, played a certain role in Nazi symbolism. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to Heinrich Himmler, and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the Schutzstaffel (\"SS\"), the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the SS-Ehrenring, which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".[citation needed]\n\nModern paganism and esotericism[edit]\nRunes are popular in New Age esotericism, modern Germanic paganism, and to a lesser extent in other forms of modern paganism. Various systems of Runic divination have been published since the 1980s, notably by Ralph Blum (1982), Stephen Flowers (1984, onward), Stephan Grundy (1990), and Nigel Pennick (1995).[citation needed]\nThe Uthark theory originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by Sigurd Agrell in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist Thomas Karlsson popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.[citation needed]\n\nBluetooth[edit]\nBluetooth logo with the initials of Harald BlÃ¥tand\nThe Bluetooth logo is the combination of two runes of the Younger Futhark, áš¼ hagall and á›’ bjarkan, equivalent to the letters H and B, that are the initials of Harald â€œBluetoothâ€ Gormsson\'s name (Bluetooth in English), who was a king of Denmark from the Viking Age.[citation needed]\n\nFantasy Literature[edit]\nSee also: Cirth Â§ Runes from The Hobbit\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien\'s novel The Hobbit (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map and on the title page to emphasize its connection to the Dwarves. They also were used in the initial drafts of The Lord of the Rings, but later were replaced by the Cirth rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, Khuzdul.  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in fantasy literature, like in J. K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter, where Runes is a subject taught at Hogwarts, also in the 7th book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore gave Hermione a children\'s book called The Tales of Beedle the Bard which is written in runes.[citation needed]\n\nVideo, board and role-playing games[edit]\nRunes feature extensively in many video games that incorporate themes from early Germanic cultures, including Hellblade: Senua\'s Sacrifice, JÃ¸tun, Northgard and God of War. They are used for a range of purposes including as names, symbols, decoration and on runestones that provide information about Nordic mythology and background for the game\'s narrative.[59][60][61]\nThe 1992 video game Heimdall used runes as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces. Role-playing games, such as the Ultima series, use a runic font for in-game signs and printed maps and booklets, and Metagaming\'s The Fantasy Trip used rune-based cipher for clues and jokes throughout its publications.[citation needed]\n\nUnicode[edit]\nMain article: Runic (Unicode block)\nRunic steel stamps, Elder Futhark\nRunic alphabets were added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\nThe Unicode block for Runic alphabets is U+16A0â€“U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the Elder Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian runes, and the Younger Futhark long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"unification\".\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0â€“U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB á›«, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC á›¬ and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED á›­), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern runic calendar staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic Arlaug Symbol U+16EE á›®, Runic Tvimadur Symbol U+16EF á›¯, Runic Belgthor Symbol U+16F0 á›°). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to J. R. R. Tolkien\'s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \"cryptogrammic\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the Franks Casket.\n\n\n\nRunic[1][2]Official Unicode Consortium code chart (PDF)\n\n\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n\n\nU+16Ax\n\náš \n\náš¡\n\náš¢\n\náš£\n\náš¤\n\náš¥\n\náš¦\n\náš§\n\náš¨\n\náš©\n\nášª\n\náš«\n\náš¬\n\náš­\n\náš®\n\náš¯\n\n\nU+16Bx\n\náš°\n\náš±\n\náš²\n\náš³\n\náš´\n\nášµ\n\náš¶\n\náš·\n\náš¸\n\náš¹\n\nášº\n\náš»\n\náš¼\n\náš½\n\náš¾\n\náš¿\n\n\nU+16Cx\n\ná›€\n\ná›\n\ná›‚\n\ná›ƒ\n\ná›„\n\ná›…\n\ná›†\n\ná›‡\n\ná›ˆ\n\ná›‰\n\ná›Š\n\ná›‹\n\ná›Œ\n\ná›\n\ná›\n\ná›\n\n\nU+16Dx\n\ná›\n\ná›‘\n\ná›’\n\ná›“\n\ná›”\n\ná›•\n\ná›–\n\ná›—\n\ná›˜\n\ná›™\n\ná›š\n\ná››\n\ná›œ\n\ná›\n\ná›\n\ná›Ÿ\n\n\nU+16Ex\n\ná› \n\ná›¡\n\ná›¢\n\ná›£\n\ná›¤\n\ná›¥\n\ná›¦\n\ná›§\n\ná›¨\n\ná›©\n\ná›ª\n\ná›«\n\ná›¬\n\ná›­\n\ná›®\n\ná›¯\n\n\nU+16Fx\n\ná›°\n\ná›±\n\ná›²\n\ná›³\n\ná›´\n\ná›µ\n\ná›¶\n\ná›·\n\ná›¸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n1.^ As of Unicode version 15.1\n2.^ Grey areas indicate non-assigned code points\n\nSee also[edit]\nBautil\nGothic runic inscriptions\nEtruscan alphabet\nList of runestones\nPentadic numerals â€“ Runic notation for presenting numbers\nOgham\nRuniform (disambiguation), various scripts having a \"rune-like\" appearance\nRunic magic\nSveriges runinskrifter\nLetter symbolism\nFootnotes[edit]\n\n\n^  The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of Vimose, Funen, Denmark.[15] The inscription reads harja; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the Meldorf fibula in southern Jutland.\n\n^ Inscriptions such as wagnija, niÃ¾ijo, and harija are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be Vangiones, the Nidensis, and the Harii tribes located in the Rhineland.[23] Since names ending in -io reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending -ius, and the suffix -inius was reflected by Germanic -inio-,[24][25] the question of the problematic ending -ijo in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of laguÃ¾ewa[26] may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".[23]\n\n^  Penzl & Hall 1994a assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the Gallehus horns inscription.[27]\n\n^ The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.[28]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Himelfarb, Elizabeth J. \"First Alphabet Found in Egypt\", Archaeology 53, Issue 1 (January/February 2000): 21.\n\n^ Runic (PDF) (chart), Unicode, archived (PDF) from the original on 2021-10-07, retrieved 2018-03-24.\n\n^ Spurkland, Terje (2005).

Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae. \nThere are about 75 species, and these are divided among four subgenera. The name \"tulip\" is thought to be derived from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble by those who discovered it. Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have become widely naturalised and cultivated (see map). In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and mountainous areas with temperate climates. Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot from the underground bulb in early spring.\nGrowing wild over much of the Near East and Central Asia, tulips had probably been cultivated in Persia from the 10th century. By the 15th century, tulips were among the most prized flowers; becoming the symbol of the later Ottomans. Tulips were cultivated in Byzantine Constantinople as early as 1055 but they did not come to the attention of Northern Europeans until the sixteenth century, when Northern European diplomats to the Ottoman court observed and reported on them.[2] They were rapidly introduced into Northern Europe and became a much-sought-after commodity during tulip mania. Tulips were frequently depicted in Dutch Golden Age paintings, and have become associated with the Netherlands, the major producer for world markets, ever since. In the seventeenth-century Netherlands, during the time of the tulip mania, an infection of tulip bulbs by the tulip breaking virus created variegated patterns in the tulip flowers that were much admired and valued. While truly broken tulips are not cultivated anymore, the closest available specimens today are part of the group known as the Rembrandts – so named because Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of his time.[3]\nBreeding programmes have produced thousands of hybrid and cultivars in addition to the original species (known in horticulture as botanical tulips). They are popular throughout the world, both as ornamental garden plants and as cut flowers.\n\n\nDescription[edit]\nTulip morphologyBulbs, showing tunic and scalesCup-shaped flower of Tulipa orphanideaStar-shaped flower of Tulipa clusiana with three sepals and three petals, forming six identical tepals\nTulips are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes that bloom in spring and die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between 10 and 70 cm (4 and 28 inches) high.[citation needed]\nTulip stems have few leaves. Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip\'s leaf is cauline (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem. These fleshy blades are often bluish-green in colour.[4][5][6] The bulbs are truncated basally and elongated towards the apex. They are covered by a protective tunic (tunicate) which can be glabrous or hairy inside.[7][6]\n\nFlowers[edit]\nThe tulip\'s flowers are usually large and are actinomorphic (radially symmetric) and hermaphrodite (contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics), generally erect, or more rarely pendulous, and are arranged more usually as a single terminal flower, or when pluriflor as two to three (e.g. Tulipa turkestanica), but up to four, flowers on the end of a floriferous stem (scape), which is single arising from amongst the basal leaf rosette. In structure, the flower is generally cup or star-shaped. As with other members of Liliaceae the perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six free (i.e. apotepalous) caducous tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each. The two whorls represent three petals and three sepals, but are termed tepals because they are nearly identical. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal-like), being brightly coloured, but each whorl may be different, or have different coloured blotches at their bases, forming darker colouration on the interior surface. The inner petals have a small, delicate cleft at the top, while the sturdier outer ones form uninterrupted ovals.[3]\nThe flowers have six distinct, basifixed introrse stamens arranged in two whorls of three, which vary in length and may be glabrous or hairy. The filaments are shorter than the tepals and dilated towards their base.[7] The style is short or absent and each stigma has three distinct lobes, and the ovaries are superior, with three chambers.[7]\n\nColours[edit]\nThe \"Semper Augustus\" was the most expensive tulip during the 17th-century tulip mania. “The colour is white, with Carmine on a blue base, and with an unbroken flame right to the top” – wrote Nicolas van Wassenaer in 1624 after seeing the tulip in the garden of one Dr Adriaen Pauw, a director of the new East India Company. With limited specimens in existence at the time and most owned by Pauw, his refusal to sell any flowers, despite wildly escalating offers, is believed by some to have sparked the mania.[3]\nTulip flowers come in a wide variety of colours, except pure blue (several tulips with \"blue\" in the name have a faint violet hue), and have absent nectaries.[4][5][6][7] Tulip flowers are generally bereft of scent and are the coolest of floral characters. The Dutch regarded this lack of scent as a virtue, as it demonstrates the flower\'s chasteness.[3]\nWhile tulips can be bred to display a wide variety of colours, black tulips have historically been difficult to achieve. The Queen of the Night tulip is as close to black as a flower gets, though it is, in fact, a dark and glossy maroonish purple - nonetheless, an effect prized by the Dutch.[3] The first truly black tulip was bred in 1986 by a Dutch flower grower in Bovenkarspel, Netherlands. The specimen was created by cross-breeding two deep purple tulips, the Queen of the Night and Wienerwald tulips.[8]\n\nFruit[edit]\nThe tulip\'s fruit is a globose or ellipsoid capsule with a leathery covering and an ellipsoid to globe shape. Each capsule contains numerous flat, disc-shaped seeds in two rows per chamber.[9] These light to dark brown seeds have very thin seed coats and endosperm that do not normally fill the entire seed.[10][7]\n\nPhytochemistry[edit]\nTulipanin is an anthocyanin found in tulips. It is the 3-rutinoside of delphinidin. The chemical compounds named tuliposides and tulipalins can also be found in tulips and are responsible for allergies.[11] Tulipalin A, or α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, is a common allergen, generated by hydrolysis of the glucoside tuliposide A. It induces a dermatitis that is mostly occupational and affects tulip bulb sorters and florists who cut the stems and leaves.[12] Tulipanin A and B are toxic to horses, cats and dogs.[13] The colour of a tulip is formed from two pigments working in concert; a base colour that is always yellow or white, and a second laid-on anthocyanin colour. The mix of these two hues determines the visible unitary colour. The breaking of flowers occurs when a virus suppresses anthocyanin and the base colour is exposed as a streak.[3]\n\nFragrance[edit]\nThe great majority of tulips, both species and cultivars, have no discernable scent, but a few of both are scented to a degree, and Anna Pavord describes T. Hungarica as \"strongly scented\",[14] and among cultivars, some such as \"Monte Carlo\" and \"Brown Sugar\" are \"scented\", and \"Creme Upstar\" \"fragrant\".[15]\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\nMain article: Taxonomy of Tulipa\nTulipa is a genus of the lily family, Liliaceae, once one of the largest families of monocots, but which molecular phylogenetics has reduced to a monophyletic grouping with only 15 genera. Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within Lilioideae, one of three subfamilies, with two tribes. Tribe Lilieae includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa.\n\nSubdivision[edit]\nThe genus, which includes about 75 species, is divided into four subgenera.[6]\n\nClusianae (4 species)\nOrithyia (4 species)\nTulipa (52 species)\nEriostemones (16 species)\nEtymology[edit]\nThe word tulip, first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \"Turkish Letters\" of diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, first appeared in English as tulipa or tulipant, entering the language by way of French: tulipe and its obsolete form tulipan or by way of Modern Latin tulipa, from Ottoman Turkish tülbend (\"muslin\" or \"gauze\"), and may be ultimately derived from the Persian: دلبند delband (\"Turban\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban.[16] This may have been due to a translation error in early times when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans. The translator possibly confused the flower for the turban.[6]\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq stated that the \"Turks\" used the word tulipan to describe the flower. Extensive speculation has tried to understand why he would state this, given that the Turkish word for tulip is lale. It is from this speculation that tulipan being a translation error referring to turbans is derived. This etymology has been challenged and makes no assumptions about possible errors. At no point does Busbecq state this was the word used in Turkey, he simply states it was used by the \"Turks\". On his way to Constantinople Busbecq states he travelled through Hungary and used Hungarian guides. Until recent times \"Turk\" was a common term when referring to Hungarians. The word tulipan is in fact the Hungarian word for tulip. As long as one recognizes \"Turk\" as a reference to Hungarians, no amount of speculation is required to reconcile the word\'s origin or form. Busbecq may have been simply repeating the word used by his \"Turk/Hungarian\" guides.[17]\nThe Hungarian word tulipan may be adopted from an Indo-Aryan reference to the tulip as a symbol of resurrection,  tala meaning \"bottom or underworld\" and pAna meaning \"defence\".[17] Prior to arriving in Europe the Hungarians, and other Finno-Ugrians, embraced the Indo-Iranian cult of the dead, Yima/Yama, and would have been familiar with all of its symbols including the tulip.[18]\n\nDistribution and habitat[edit]\nEastern end of the tulip range from Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains\nTulips are mainly distributed along a band corresponding to latitude 40° north, from southeast of Europe (Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Southern Serbia, Bulgaria, most part of Romania, Ukraine, Russia) and Turkey in the west, through the Levant (Syria, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Lebanon and Jordan) and the Sinai Peninsula. From there it extends eastwards through Jerevan (Armenia), and Baku (Azerbaijan) and on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan, Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), to the eastern end of the range in the Pamir-Alai and Tien-Shan mountains in Central Asia, which form the centre of diversity.[19] Further to the east, Tulipa is found in the western Himalayas, southern Siberia, Inner Mongolia, and as far as the northwest of China. While authorities have stated that no tulips west of the Balkans are native,[20] subsequent identification of Tulipa sylvestris subsp. australis as a native of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent North Africa shows that this may be a simplification. In addition to these regions in the west tulips have been identified in Greece, Cyprus and the Balkans. In the south, Iran marks its furthest extent, while the northern limit is Ukraine.[21] Although tulips are also throughout most of the Mediterranean and Europe, these regions do not form part of the natural distribution. Tulips were brought to Europe by travellers and merchants from Anatolia and Central Asia for cultivation, from where they escaped and naturalised (see map). For instance, less than half of those species found in Turkey are actually native.[20] These have been referred to as neo-tulipae.[22][23][6]\nTulips are indigenous to mountainous areas with temperate climates, where they are a common element of steppe and winter-rain Mediterranean vegetation.  They thrive in climates with long, cool springs and dry summers. Tulips are most commonly found in meadows, steppes and chaparral, but also introduced in fields, orchards, roadsides and abandoned gardens.[22][6]\n\nEcology[edit]\nVariegation produced by the tulip breaking virus\nBotrytis tulipae is a major fungal disease affecting tulips, causing cell death and eventually the rotting of the plant.[24] Other pathogens include anthracnose, bacterial soft rot, blight caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, bulb nematodes, other rots including blue molds, black molds and mushy rot.[25]\nThe fungus Trichoderma viride can infect tulips, producing dried leaf tips and reduced growth, although symptoms are usually mild and only present on bulbs growing in glasshouses.[citation needed]\nVariegated tulips admired during the Dutch tulipomania gained their delicately feathered patterns from an infection with the tulip breaking virus, a mosaic virus that was carried by the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. While the virus produces fantastically streaked flowers, it also weakens plants and reduces the number of offsets produced. Dutch growers would go to extraordinary lengths during tulipomania to make tulips break, borrowing alchemists’ techniques and resorting to sprinkling paint powders of the desired hue or pigeon droppings onto flower roots.[3]\nTulips affected by the mosaic virus are called \"broken\"; while such plants can occasionally revert to a plain or solid colouring, they will remain infected and have to be destroyed. Today the virus is almost eradicated from tulip growers\' fields. The multicoloured patterns of modern varieties result from breeding; they normally have solid, un-feathered borders between the colours.\nTulip growth is also dependent on temperature conditions. Slightly germinated plants show greater growth if subjected to a period of cool dormancy, known as vernalisation. Furthermore, although flower development is induced at warmer temperatures (20–25 °C or 68–77 °F), elongation of the flower stalk and proper flowering is dependent on an extended period of low temperature (< 10 °C or 50 °F).[26] Tulip bulbs imported to warm-winter areas are often planted in autumn to be treated as annuals.\nThe colour of tulip flowers also varies with growing conditions.[27]\n\nCultivation[edit]\nHistory[edit]\nIslamic World[edit]\nTulipa sylvestris subsp. australis[a] with seedpod by Sydenham Edwards (1804)[28]\nCultivation of the tulip began in Iran (Persia), probably in the 10th century.[6] Early cultivars must have emerged from hybridisation in gardens from wild collected plants, which were then favoured, possibly due to flower size or growth vigour. The tulip is not mentioned by any writer from antiquity,[29] therefore it seems probable that tulips were introduced into Anatolia only with the advance of the Seljuks.[29] In the Ottoman Empire, numerous types of tulips were cultivated and bred,[30] and today, 14 species can still be found in Turkey.[29] Tulips are mentioned by Omar Kayam and Jalāl ad-Dīn Rûmi.[29] Species of tulips in Turkey typically come in red, less commonly in white or yellow. The Ottoman Turks had discovered that these wild tulips were great changelings, freely hybridizing (though it takes 7 years to show colour) but also subject to mutations that produced spontaneous changes in form and colour.[3]\nA paper by Arthur Baker[31] reports that in 1574, Sultan Selim II ordered the Kadi of A‘azāz in Syria to send him 50,000 tulip bulbs. However, John Harvey[32] points out several problems with this source, and there is also the possibility that tulips and hyacinth (sümbüll), originally Indian spikenard (Nardostachys jatamansi) have been confused. Sultan Selim also imported 300,000 bulbs of Kefe Lale (also known as Cafe-Lale, from the medieval name Kaffa, probably Tulipa schrenkii) from Kefe in Crimea, for his gardens in the Topkapı Sarayı in Istanbul.[33]\nIt is also reported that shortly after arriving in Constantinople in 1554, Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq, ambassador of the Austrian Habsburgs to the court of Suleyman the Magnificent, claimed to have introduced the tulip to Europe by sending a consignment of bulbs west. The fact that the tulip\'s first official trip west took it from one court to the other could have contributed to its ascendency.[3]\nSultan Ahmet III maintained famous tulip gardens in the summer highland pastures (Yayla) at Spil Dağı above the town of Manisa.[34] They seem to have consisted of wild tulips. However, of the 14 tulip species known from Turkey, only four are considered to be of local origin,[35] so wild tulips from Iran and Central Asia may have been brought into Turkey during the Seljuk and especially Ottoman periods. Also, Sultan Ahmet imported domestic tulip bulbs from the Netherlands.\nThe gardening book Revnak\'ı Bostan (Beauty of the Garden) by Sahibül Reis ülhaç Ibrahim Ibn ülhaç Mehmet, written in 1660 does not mention the tulip at all, but contains advice on growing hyacinths and lilies.[36] However, there is considerable confusion of terminology, and tulips may have been subsumed under hyacinth, a mistake several European botanists were to perpetuate. In 1515, the scholar  Qasim from Herat in contrast had identified both wild and garden tulips (lale) as anemones (shaqayq al-nu\'man),  but described the crown imperial as laleh kakli.[36]\nIn a  Turkic text written before 1495, the Chagatay Husayn Bayqarah mentions tulips (lale).[37] Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, also names tulips in the Baburnama.[38] He may actually have introduced them from Afghanistan to the plains of India, as he did with other plants like melons and grapes.[39] The tulip represents the official symbol of Turkey.[40]\nIn Moorish Andalus, a \"Makedonian bulb\" (basal al-maqdunis) or \"bucket-Narcissus\" (naryis qadusi) was cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It was supposed to have come from Alexandria and may have been Tulipa sylvestris, but the identification is not wholly secure.[41]\n\nIntroduction to Western Europe[edit]\nTulip cultivation in the Netherlands\nThe Keukenhof in Lisse, Netherlands\nAlthough it is unknown who first brought the tulip to Northwestern Europe, the most widely accepted story is that it was Oghier Ghislain de Busbecq, an ambassador for Emperor Ferdinand I to Suleyman the Magnificent. According to a letter, he saw \"an abundance of flowers everywhere; Narcissus, hyacinths and those in Turkish called Lale, much to our astonishment because it was almost midwinter, a season unfriendly to flowers.\"[42][43] However, in 1559, an account by Conrad Gessner describes tulips flowering in Augsburg, Swabia in the garden of Councillor Heinrich Herwart.[44] In Central and Northern Europe, tulip bulbs are generally removed from the ground in June and must be replanted by September for the winter.[citation needed] It is doubtful that Busbecq could have had the tulip bulbs harvested, shipped to Germany and replanted between March 1558 and Gessner\'s description the following year. Pietro Andrea Mattioli illustrated a tulip in 1565 but identified it as a narcissus.\nCarolus Clusius is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the 16th century; he planted tulips at the Vienna Imperial Botanical Gardens in 1573. He finished the first major work on tulips in 1592 and made note of the colour variations. After he was appointed the director of the Leiden University\'s newly established Hortus Botanicus, he planted both a teaching garden and his private garden with tulips in late 1593. Thus, 1594 is considered the date of the tulip\'s first flowering in the Netherlands, despite reports of the cultivation of tulips in private gardens in Antwerp and Amsterdam two or three decades earlier. These tulips at Leiden would eventually lead to both the tulip mania and the tulip industry in the Netherlands.[45] Over two raids, in 1596 and in 1598, more than one hundred bulbs were stolen from his garden.\nTulips spread rapidly across Europe, and more opulent varieties such as double tulips were already known in Europe by the early 17th century. These curiosities fitted well in an age when natural oddities were cherished especially in the Netherlands, France, Germany and England, where the spice trade with the East Indies had made many people wealthy. Nouveaux riches seeking wealthy displays embraced the exotic plant market, especially in the Low Countries where gardens had become fashionable. A craze for bulbs soon grew in France, where in the early 17th century, entire properties were exchanged as payment for a single tulip bulb. The value of the flower gave it an aura of mystique, and numerous publications describing varieties in lavish garden manuals were published, cashing in on the value of the flower. An export business was built up in France, supplying Dutch, Flemish, German and English buyers. The trade drifted slowly from the French to the Dutch.[46]\nBetween 1634 and 1637, the enthusiasm for the new flowers in Holland triggered a speculative frenzy now known as the tulip mania that eventually led to the collapse of the market three years later. Tulip bulbs had become so expensive that they were treated as a form of currency, or rather, as futures, forcing the Dutch government to introduce trading restrictions on the bulbs.[46] Around this time, the ceramic tulipiere was devised for the display of cut flowers stem by stem. Vases and bouquets, usually including tulips, often appeared in Dutch still-life painting. To this day, tulips are associated with the Netherlands, and the cultivated forms of the tulip are often called \"Dutch tulips\". The Netherlands has the world\'s largest permanent display of tulips at the Keukenhof.\nThe majority of tulip cultivars are classified in the taxon Tulipa ×gesneriana. They have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from Tulipa suaveolens (today often regarded as a synonym with Tulipa schrenkii). Tulipa ×gesneriana is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is probably not the same taxon as was described by Conrad Gessner in the 16th century.[6]\nThe UK\'s National Collection of English florists\' tulips and Dutch historic tulips, dating from the early 17th century to c. 1960, is held by Polly Nicholson at Blackland House, near Calne in Wiltshire.[47]\n\nIntroduction to the United States[edit]\nThe Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden\nIt is believed the first tulips in the United States were grown near Spring Pond at the Fay Estate in Lynn and Salem, Massachusetts. From 1847 to 1865, Richard Sullivan Fay, Esq., one of Lynn\'s wealthiest men, settled on 500 acres (2 km2; 202 ha) located partly in present-day Lynn and partly in present-day Salem. Mr. Fay imported many different trees and plants from all parts of the world and planted them among the meadows of the Fay Estate.[48]\n\nPropagation[edit]\nTulip pistil surrounded by stamensTulip stamen with pollen grainsThe reproductive organs of a tulip\nThe Netherlands is the world\'s main producer of commercial tulip plants, producing as many as 3 billion bulbs annually, the majority for export.[49]\n\"Unlike many flower species, tulips do not produce nectar to entice insect pollination. Instead, tulips rely on wind and land animals to move their pollen between reproductive organs. Because they are self-pollinating, they do not need the pollen to move several feet to another plant but only within their blossoms.\"[50]\nTulips can be propagated through bulb offsets, seeds or micropropagation.[51] Offsets and tissue culture methods are means of asexual propagation for producing genetic clones of the parent plant, which maintains cultivar genetic integrity. Seeds are most often used to propagate species and subspecies or to create new hybrids. Many tulip species can cross-pollinate with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often sterile.\nOffsets require a year or more of growth before plants are large enough to flower. Tulips grown from seeds often need five to eight years before plants are of flowering size. To prevent cross-pollination, increase the growth rate of bulbs and increase the vigour and size of offsets, the flower and stems of a field of commercial tulips are usually topped using large tractor-mounted mowing heads. The same goals can be achieved by a private gardener by clipping the stem and flower of an individual specimen. Commercial growers usually harvest the tulip bulbs in late summer and grade them into sizes; bulbs large enough to flower are sorted and sold, while smaller bulbs are sorted into sizes and replanted for sale in the future.\nBecause tulip bulbs don\'t reliably come back every year, tulip varieties that fall out of favour with present aesthetic values have traditionally gone extinct. Unlike other flowers that do not suffer this same limitation, the Tulip\'s historical forms do not survive alongside their modern incarnations.[3]\n\nHorticultural classification[edit]\n\'Gavota\', a division 3 cultivar\n\'Yonina\', a division 6 cultivar\n\'Texas Flame\', a division 10 cultivar\nIn horticulture, tulips are divided into fifteen groups (Divisions) mostly based on flower morphology and plant size.[52][53]\n\nDiv. 1: Single early – with cup-shaped single flowers, no larger than 8 cm (3 inches) across. They bloom early to mid-season. Growing 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 inches) tall.\nDiv. 2: Double early – with fully double flowers, bowl shaped to 8 cm (3 inches) across. Plants typically grow from 30–40 cm (12–16 inches) tall.\nDiv. 3: Triumph – single, cup shaped flowers up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 35–60 cm (14–24 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season.\nDiv. 4: Darwin hybrid – single flowers are ovoid in shape and up to 6 cm (2.5 inches) wide. Plants grow 50–70 cm (20–28 inches) tall and bloom mid to late season. This group should not be confused with older Darwin tulips, which belong in the Single Late Group below.\nDiv. 5: Single late – cup or goblet-shaped flowers up to 8 cm (3 inches) wide, some plants produce multi-flowering stems. Plants grow 45–75 cm (18–30 inches) tall and bloom late season.\nDiv. 6: Lily-flowered – the flowers possess a distinct narrow \'waist\' with pointed and reflexed petals. Previously included with the old Darwins, only became a group in their own right in 1958.[54]\nDiv. 7: Fringed (Crispa) – cup or goblet-shaped blossoms edged with spiked or crystal-like fringes, sometimes called “tulips for touch” because of the temptation to “test” the fringes to see if they are real or made of glass. Perennials with a tendency to naturalize in woodland areas, growing 45–65 cm (18–26 inches) tall and blooming in late season.\nDiv. 8: Viridiflora\nDiv. 9: Rembrandt\nDiv. 10: Parrot\nDiv. 11: Double late – Large, heavy blooms. They range from 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches) tall.\nDiv. 12: Kaufmanniana – Waterlily tulip. Medium-large creamy yellow flowers marked red on the outside and yellow at the centre. Stems 15 cm (6 inches) tall.\nDiv. 13: Fosteriana (Emperor)\nDiv. 14: Greigii – Scarlet flowers 15 cm (6 inches) across, on 15-centimetre (6 in) stems. Foliage mottled with brown.[55]\nDiv. 15: Species or Botanical – The terms \"species tulips\" and \"botanical tulips\" refer to wild species in contrast to hybridised varieties.[56] As a group they have been described as being less ostentatious but more reliably vigorous as they age.[57][58]\nDiv. 16: Multiflowering – not an official division, these tulips belong in the first 15 divisions but are often listed separately because they have multiple blooms per bulb.\nThey may also be classified by their flowering season:[59]\n\nEarly flowering: Single Early Tulips, Double Early Tulips, Greigii Tulips, Kaufmanniana Tulips, Fosteriana Tulips, § Species tulips\nMid-season flowering: Darwin Hybrid Tulips, Triumph Tulips, Parrot Tulips\nLate season flowering: Single Late Tulips, Double Late Tulips, Viridiflora Tulips, Lily-flowering Tulips, Fringed (Crispa) Tulips, Rembrandt Tulips\nNeo-tulipae[edit]\nTulip bulb planting depth 15 cm (6 inches)\nA number of names are based on naturalised garden tulips and are usually referred to as neo-tulipae. These are often difficult to trace back to their original cultivar, and in some cases have been occurring in the wild for many centuries. The history of naturalisation is unknown, but populations are usually associated with agricultural practices and are possibly linked to saffron cultivation[clarification needed]. Some neo-tulipae have been brought into cultivation, and are often offered as botanical tulips. These cultivated plants can be classified into two Cultivar Groups: \'Grengiolensis Group\', with picotee tepals, and the \'Didieri Group\' with unicolourous tepals.\n\nHorticulture[edit]\nTulip bulbs are typically planted around late summer and fall, in well-drained soils. Tulips should be planted 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) apart from each other. The recommended hole depth is 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) deep and is measured from the top of the bulb to the surface. Therefore, larger tulip bulbs would require deeper holes. Species tulips are normally planted deeper.[citation needed]\n\nCulture and politics[edit]\nIran[edit]\nThe celebration of Persian New Year, or Nowruz, dating back over 3,000 years,  marks the advent of spring, and tulips are used as a decorative feature during the festivities.[60]\nA sixth-century legend, similar to the tale of Romeo and Juliet, tells of tulips sprouting where the blood of the young prince Farhad spilt after he killed himself upon hearing the (deliberately false) story that his true love had died.[60]\nThe tulip was a topic for Persian poets from the thirteenth century. The poem Gulistan by Musharrifu\'d-din Saadi, described a visionary garden paradise with \"The murmur of a cool stream / bird song, ripe fruit in plenty / bright multicoloured tulips and fragrant roses...\".[61] In recent times, tulips have featured in the poems of Simin Behbahani.[citation needed]\nThe tulip is the national symbol for martyrdom in Iran[62] (and Shi\'ite Islam generally), and has been used on postage stamps and coins. It was common as a symbol used in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a red tulip adorns the flag redesigned in 1980. The sword in the centre, with four crescent-shaped petals around it, create the word \"Allah\" as well as symbolising the five pillars of Islam. The tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is decorated with 72 stained glass tulips, representing 72 martyrs who died at the Battle of Karbala in 680CE. It was also used as a symbol on billboards celebrating casualties of the 1980–1988 war with Iraq.[60]\nThe tulip also became a symbol of protest against the Iranian government after the presidential election in June 2009, when millions turned out on the streets to protest the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After the protests were harshly suppressed, the Iranian Green Movement adopted the tulip as a symbol of their struggle.[60]\nThe word for tulip in Persian is \"laleh\" (لاله), and this has become popular as a girl\'s name.[62] The name has been used for commercial enterprises, such as the Laleh International Hotel, as well as public facilities, such as Laleh Park[60] and Laleh Hospital,[63] and the tulip motif remains common in Iranian culture.[60]\n\n\nIranian 20 rial coin\n\n\nObverse with 22 tulips\n\n\n\nReverse with three tulips\n\n\nIn other countries and cultures[edit]\nTurkish Airlines uses a grey tulip emblem on its aircraft\nTulips are called lale in Turkish (from the Persian: لاله, romanized: laleh from لال lal \'red\'[64]). When written in Arabic letters, lale has the same letters as Allah, which is why the flower became a holy symbol. It was also associated with the House of Osman, resulting in tulips being widely used in decorative motifs on tiles, mosques, fabrics, crockery, etc. in the Ottoman Empire.[6] The tulip was seen as a symbol of abundance and indulgence. The era during which the Ottoman Empire was wealthiest is often called the Tulip era or Lale Devri in Turkish.\nTulips became popular garden plants in the east and west, but, whereas the tulip in Turkish culture was a symbol of paradise on earth and had almost a divine status, in the Netherlands it represented the briefness of life.[6]\nIn Christianity, tulips symbolise passion, belief and love. White tulips represent forgiveness while purple tulips represent royalty, both important aspects of Easter.[citation needed] In Calvinism, the five points of the doctrines of grace have been summarized under the acrostic TULIP.[65][66]\nBy contrast to other flowers such as the coneflower or lotus flower, tulips have historically been capable of genetically reinventing themselves to suit changes in aesthetic values. In his 1597 herbal, John Gerard says of the tulip that \"nature seems to play more with this flower than with any other that I do know\". When in the Netherlands, beauty was defined by marbled swirls of vivid contrasting colours, the petals of tulips were able to become \"feathered\" and \"flamed\". However, in the 19th century, when the English desired tulips for carpet bedding and massing, the tulips were able to once again accommodate this by evolving into \"paint-filled boxes with the brightest, fattest dabs of pure pigment\". This inherent mutability of the tulip even led the Ottoman Turks to believe that nature cherished this flower above all others.[3]\nThe Black Tulip (1850) is a historical romance by Alexandre Dumas, père. The story takes place in the Dutch city of Haarlem, where a reward is offered to the first grower who can produce a truly black tulip.[citation needed]\nThe tulip occurs on a number of the Major Arcana cards of occultist Oswald Wirth\'s deck of Tarot cards, specifically the Magician, Emperor, Temperance and the Fool, described in his 1927 work Le Tarot, des Imagiers du Moyen Âge.[67][68]\n\nTulip festivals[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

There is also a popular festival in Morges, Switzerland. Every spring, there are tulip festivals in North America, including the Tulip Time Festival in Holland, Michigan, the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Skagit Valley, Washington, the Tulip Time Festival in Orange City and Pella, Iowa, and the Canadian Tulip Festival in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Tulips are also popular in Australia and several festivals are held in September and October, during the Southern Hemisphere\'s spring. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden hosts an annual tulip festival which draws huge attention and has an attendance of over 200,000.\n\nConsumption[edit]\nTulip petals are edible. The taste varies by variety and season, and is roughly similar to lettuce or other salad greens. Some people are allergic to tulips.[70][71]\nTulip bulbs look similar to onions, but should not generally be considered food. The toxicity of bulbs is not well understood, nor is there an agreed-upon method of safely preparing them for human consumption. There have been reports of illness when eaten, depending on quantity.[72] During the Dutch famine of 1944–45, tulip bulbs were eaten out of desperation, and Dutch doctors provided recipes.[73][74]\n\nAnimals[edit]\nAs with other plants of the lily family, tulips are poisonous to domestic animals including horses, cats and dogs.[13] In cats, ingestion of small amounts of tulips can include vomiting, depression, diarrhoea, hypersalivation, and irritation of the mouth and throat, and larger amounts can cause abdominal pain, tremors, tachycardia, convulsions, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. All parts of the tulip plant are poisonous to cats, while the bulb is especially dangerous. A veterinarian should be contacted immediately if a cat has ingested tulip.[75] In the American East, white-tailed deer eat tulips,[76] with no apparent ill effects.\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Award of Garden Merit tulips\nTulip period\nExplanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n^ Illustration of Tulipa sylvestris subsp. australis, identified as Tulipa breyniana\n\n\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b \"Tulipa L\".

Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs; they affect the ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes. What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases, or alters. An object with \"ethic value\" may be termed an \"ethic or philosophic good\" (noun sense).[1]\nValues can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person\'s sense of right and wrong or what \"ought\" to be. \"Equal rights for all\", \"Excellence deserves admiration\",  and \"People should be treated with respect and dignity\" are representatives of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include ethical/moral values, doctrinal/ideological (religious, political) values, social values, and aesthetic values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as altruism, are intrinsic, and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as vices or virtues.\n\n\nFields of study[edit]\nEthical issues that value may be regarded as a study under ethics, which, in turn, may be grouped as philosophy. Similarly, ethical value may be regarded as a subgroup of a broader field of philosophic value sometimes referred to as axiology. Ethical value denotes something\'s degree of importance, with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions.\nThe study of ethical value is also included in value theory. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: anthropology, behavioral economics, business ethics, corporate governance, moral philosophy, political sciences, social psychology, sociology and theology.\n\nSimilar concepts[edit]\nEthical value is sometimes used synonymously with goodness. However, goodness has many other meanings and may be regarded as more ambiguous.\n\nTypes of value[edit]\nPersonal versus cultural[edit]\nPersonal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms. A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive. Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.\n\nRelative or absolute[edit]\nRelative values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of absolute values,[2] which can also be termed noumenal values (and not to be confused with mathematical absolute value). An absolute value can be described as philosophically absolute and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. Ludwig Wittgenstein was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; \"we can speak as much as we want about \"life\" and \"its meaning,\" and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will\".[3]\n\nIntrinsic or extrinsic[edit]\nPhilosophic value may be split into instrumental value and intrinsic values. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value intrinsic and extrinsic properties.\nAn ethic good with instrumental value may be termed an ethic mean, and an ethic good with intrinsic value may be termed an end-in-itself. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.\n\nSummation[edit]\nIntrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories.[4] Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. \"Understanding science\" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the sum of instrumental (specifically the all instrumental value) and intrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in value systems, which is a set of consistent values and measures.\n\nUniversal values[edit]\nMain article: Universal value\nS. H. Schwartz, along with a number of psychology colleagues, has carried out empirical research investigating whether there are universal values, and what those values are. Schwartz defined \'values\' as \"conceptions of the desirable that influence the way people select action and evaluate events\".[5] He hypothesised that universal values would relate to three different types of human need: biological needs, social co-ordination needs, and needs related to the welfare and survival of groups[6]\n\nIntensity[edit]\nThe intensity of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.[4]\nIt should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of instrumental value conditionality. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.\nInstrumental value conditionality in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.\nIn many life stances it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. Maximizing life-stances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.\n\nPositive and negative value[edit]\nThere may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized,  negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized[citation needed].\n\nProtected value[edit]\nA protected value (also sacred value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many other individuals. Protected values tend to be \"intrinsically good\", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary.[7] If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called tragic trade-offs.[8]\nProtected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) because they can hinder businesslike (\'\'utilitarian\'\') negotiations.[9][10] A series of experimental studies directed by Scott Atran and Ángel Gómez among combatants on the ISIS front line in Iraq and with ordinary  citizens in Western Europe [11] suggest that commitment to sacred values motivate the most \"devoted actors\" to make the costliest sacrifices, including willingness to fight and die, as well as a readiness to forsake close kin and comrades for those values if necessary.[12] From the perspective of utilitarianism, protected values are biases when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.[13]\nAccording to Jonathan Baron and Mark Spranca,[14] protected values arise from norms as described in theories of deontological ethics (the latter often being referred to in context with Immanuel Kant). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.\n\nEconomic versus philosophic value[edit]\nFurther information: Value (economics)\nPhilosophical value is distinguished from economic value, since it is independent from some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.\nNevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the subjective theory of value, the personal philosophic value a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the personal philosophic value of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a \"personal economic value\" in contrast to its \"societal economic value.\"\n\nPersonal values[edit]\nPersonal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values are one of the factors that generate behavior (besides needs, interests and habits) and influence the choices made by an individual.\nValues may help common human problems for survival by comparative rankings of value, the results of which provide answers to questions of why people do what they do and in what order they choose to do them.[clarification needed] Moral, religious, and personal values, when held rigidly, may also give rise to conflicts that result from a clash between differing world views.[15]\nOver time the public expression of personal values that groups of people find important in their day-to-day lives, lay the foundations of law, custom and tradition. Recent research has thereby stressed the implicit nature of value communication.[16] Consumer behavior research proposes there are six internal values and three external values. They are known as List of Values (LOV) in management studies. They are self respect, warm relationships, sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, fun and enjoyment, excitement, sense of belonging, being well respected, and security. From a functional aspect these values are categorized into three and they are interpersonal relationship area, personal factors, and non-personal factors.[17] From an ethnocentric perspective, it could be assumed that a same set of values will not reflect equally between two groups of people from two countries. Though the core values are related, the processing of values can differ based on the cultural identity of an individual.[18]\n\nIndividual differences[edit]\nMain article: Theory of Basic Human Values\nSchwartz proposed a theory of individual values based on surveys data. His model groups values in terms of growth versus protection, and personal versus social focus. Values are then associated with openness to change (which Schwartz views as related to personal growth), self-enhancement (which Schwartz views as mostly to do with self-protection), conservation (which Schwartz views as mostly related to social-protection), and self-transcendence (which Schwartz views as a form of social growth). Within this Schwartz places 10 universal values: self-direction, stimulation and hedonism (related to openness growth), achievement and power (related to self enhancement), security, conformity and tradition (related to conservation), and humility, benevolence and universalism (relate to self-transcendence).[19]: 523 \nPersonality traits using the big 5 measure correlate with Schwartz\'s value construct. Openness and extraversion correlates with the values related to openness-to-change (openness especially with self-direction, extraversion especially with stimulation);  agreeableness correlates with self-transcendence values (especially benevolence); extraversion is correlated with self-enhancement and negatively with traditional values. Conscientiousness correlates with achievement, conformity and security.[19]: 530 \nMen are found to value achievement, self-direction, hedonism, and stimulation more than women, while women value benevolence, universality and tradition higher.[20]: 1012 \n\nThe order of Schwartz\'s traits are substantially stability amongst adults over time. Migrants values change when they move to a new country, but the order of preferences is still quite stable. Motherhood causes women to shift their values towards stability and away from openness-to-change but not fathers.[19]: 528 Correlations between Moral foundations and Schwartz\'s basic values with values taken from[21]\nMoral foundations theory[edit]\nMain article: Moral foundations theory\nMoral foundation theory identifies five forms of moral foundation harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sancity. Harm and fairness are often called individualizing foundations, while the other three factors are termed binding foundations. The moral foundations were found to be correlated with the theory of basic human values. The strong correlations are between conservatives values and binding foundations.[22]\n\nCultural values[edit]\nIndividual cultures emphasize values which their members broadly share. Values of a society can often be identified by examining the level of honor and respect received by various groups and ideas. \nValues clarification differs from cognitive moral education:Respect\n\nValue clarification consists of \"helping people clarify what their lives are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others\' values.\"[23]\nCognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like democracy and justice as their moral reasoning develops.[23]\nValues relate to the norms of a culture, but they are more global and intellectual than norms.  Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as good or evil. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of patriotism.  Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest respect at a funeral. Different cultures represent values differently and to different levels of emphasis. \"Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others.\"[23] Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.\nMembers take part in a culture even if each member\'s personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual\'s ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple subcultures they belong to.\nIf a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group\'s norms, the group\'s authority may carry out various ways of encouraging conformity or stigmatizing the non-conforming behavior of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.\nFurthermore, cultural values can be expressed at a global level through institutions participating in the global economy. For example, values important to global governance can include leadership, legitimacy, and efficiency. Within our current global governance architecture, leadership is expressed through the G20, legitimacy through the United Nations, and efficiency through member-driven international organizations.[24] The expertise provided by international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of identity in a globalized world.[25][clarification needed]\nNonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. EU policies based on the notion of \"cultural exception\" can become juxtaposed with the liberal policy of \"cultural specificity\" in English-speaking countries. Indeed, international law traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service.[citation needed] Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.[26]\n\nDevelopment and transmission[edit]\nValues are generally received through cultural means, especially diffusion and transmission or socialization from parents to children.  Parents in different cultures have different values.[27] For example, parents in a hunter–gatherer society or surviving through subsistence agriculture value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays.[28] Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament.[27] Spanish parents want their children to be sociable.[27] Swedish parents value security and happiness.[27] Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules.[27] American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow \"book learning\" sense.[27] The Kipsigis people of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call ng\'om. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call \"nyadhi\".[27]\nFactors that influence the development of cultural values are summarized below.\nThe Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world is a two-dimensional cultural map showing the cultural values of the countries of the world along two dimensions: The traditional versus secular-rational values reflect the transition from a religious understanding of the world to a dominance of science and bureaucracy. The second dimension named survival values versus self-expression values represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society.[29]\nCultures can be distinguished as tight and loose in relation to how much they adhere to social norms and tolerates deviance.[30][31] Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. A history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. It has been suggested that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.[32][33]\nStudies in evolutionary psychology have led to similar findings. The so-called regality theory finds that war and other perceived collective dangers have a profound influence on both the psychology of individuals and on the social structure and cultural values. A dangerous environment leads to a hierarchical, authoritarian, and warlike culture, while a safe and peaceful environment fosters an egalitarian and tolerant culture.[34]\n\nValue system[edit]\nA value system is a set of consistent values used for the purpose of ethical or ideological integrity.\n\nConsistency[edit]\nAs a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are externally consistent provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.\nA value system in its own right is internally consistent when\n\nits values do not contradict each other and\nits exceptions are or could be\nabstract enough to be used in all situations and\nconsistently applied.\nConversely, a value system by itself is internally inconsistent if:\n\nits values contradict each other and\nits exceptions are\nhighly situational and\ninconsistently applied.\nValue exceptions[edit]\nAbstract exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. Situational exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:\n\nAn idealized value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called absolutists.\nA realized value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.\nThe difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a religion lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.\nImplicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a formal value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: \"as long as no higher-priority value is violated\". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone\'s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.\n\nConflict[edit]\nAlthough sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are right or wrong, both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an ideological or physical conflict. Ethonomics, the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems[citation needed], enables us to understand politics and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.\nAn example conflict would be a value system based on individualism pitted against a value system based on collectivism. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Added exceptions can become recursive and often convoluted.\n\nIndividuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others\' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.\nA society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.\nA society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.\nA society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to Value (ethics and social sciences).\n\nAttitude (psychology)\nAxiological ethics\nAxiology\nClyde Kluckhohn and his value orientation theory\nHofstede\'s Framework for Assessing Culture\nInstrumental and intrinsic value\nIntercultural communication\nMeaning of life\nPaideia\nRokeach Value Survey\nSpiral Dynamics\nThe Right and the Good\nValue judgment\nWorld Values Survey\nWestern values\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Vuong, Quan-Hoang (2023).

The core of Western civilization, broadly defined, is formed by the combined foundations of Greco-Roman civilization and Western Christianity.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] While Western culture is a broad concept, and does not relate to a region with fixed members or geographical confines, it generally relates to the cultures of countries with historical ties to a European country or a number of European countries, or to the variety of cultures within Europe itself. However, countries toward the east of Europe are sometimes excluded from definitions of the Western world.\nWestern culture is characterized by a host of artistic, philosophic, literary and legal themes and traditions. Christianity, primarily the Catholic Church,[10][11][12] and later Protestantism[13][14][15][16] has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization since at least the 4th century,[17][18][19][20][21] as did Judaism.[22][23][24][25] A cornerstone of Western thought, beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, is the idea of rationalism in various spheres of life developed by Hellenistic philosophy, scholasticism and humanism. Empiricism later gave rise to the scientific method, the scientific revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment.\nWhile traditionally shunned as a mainspring of Western civilization in favour of early Aegean cultures, the Phoenician city-states stimulated and fostered Western civilization.[26] The expansion of Greek culture into the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean led to a synthesis between Greek and Near-Eastern cultures,[27] and major advances in literature, engineering, and science, and provided the culture for the expansion of early Christianity and the Greek New Testament.[28][29][30] This period overlapped with and was followed by Rome, which made key contributions in law, government, engineering and political organization.[31]\nWestern culture continued to develop with the Christianization of European society during the Middle Ages, the reforms triggered by the medieval renaissances, the influence of the Islamic world via Al-Andalus and Sicily (including the transfer of technology from the East, and Latin translations of Arabic texts on science and philosophy by Greek and Hellenic-influenced Islamic philosophers),[32][33][34] and the Italian Renaissance as Greek scholars fleeing after the fall of Constantinople brought classical traditions and philosophy.[35] This major change for non-Western countries and their people saw a development in modernization in those countries.[36] Medieval Christianity is credited with creating the modern university,[37][38] the modern hospital system,[39] scientific economics,[40][41] and natural law (which would later influence the creation of international law).[42] European culture developed with a complex range of philosophy, medieval scholasticism, mysticism and Christian and secular humanism.[43][page needed] Rational thinking developed through a long age of change and formation, with the experiments of the Enlightenment and breakthroughs in the sciences. Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as New Age movements) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration.\n\n\nTerminology[edit]\nFurther information: Western world\nMap of the Western world, based on Samuel P. Huntington\'s 1996 Clash of Civilizations.[44] In turquoise are Latin America and the Orthodox World, which are either a part of the West or distinct civilizations intimately related to the West.[45][46][47] The World of Civilizations: Post-1990\", map from Huntington\'s Clash of Civilizations (1996) indicating the world\'s postulated nine major \"civilizations\": Western, Latin American, Orthodox, Islamic, Sinic, Buddhist, Japanese, Hindu, and African.\n\"The West\" as a geographical area is unclear and undefined. There is some disagreement about which nations should or should not be included in the category, when, and why. Certainly related conceptual terminology has changed over time in scope, meaning, and use. The term \"western\" draws on an affiliation with, or a perception of, a shared philosophy, worldview, political, and religious heritage grounded in the Greco-Roman world, the legacy of the Roman Empire, and medieval concepts of Christendom. For example, whether the Eastern Roman Empire (anachronistically/controversially referred to as the Byzantine Empire), or those countries heavily influenced by its legacy, should be counted as \"Western\" is an example of the possible ambiguity of the term. These questions[which?] can be traced back to the affiliatory nature of Roman culture to the culture of Classical Greece, a persistent Greek East and Latin West language-split within the Roman Empire, and an eventual permanent splitting of the Roman Empire in 395 into Western and Eastern halves. And perhaps, at its worst,[citation needed] culminating in Pope Leo III\'s transfer of the Roman Empire from the Eastern Roman Empire to the Frankish King Charlemagne in the form of the Holy Roman Empire in 800, the Great Schism of 1054, and the devastating Fourth Crusade of 1204. Conversely, traditions of scholarship around Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid had been forgotten in the Catholic west and were rediscovered by Italians from scholars fleeing the 1453 fall of the Eastern Roman Empire.[35] The subsequent Renaissance, a conscious effort by Europeans to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of the Greco-Roman world, eventually encouraged the Age of Discovery, the Scientific Revolution, Age of Enlightenment, and the subsequent Industrial Revolution. Similarly, complicated relationships between virtually all the countries and regions within a broadly defined \"West\" can be discussed in the light of a persistently fragmented political landscape resulting in a lack of uniformity and significant diversity between the various cultures affiliating with this shared socio-cultural heritage. Thus, those cultures identifying with the West and with what it means to be \"western\" change over time as the geopolitical circumstances of a place changes and what is meant by the terminology changes.\nIt is difficult to determine which individuals or places or trends fit into which category, and the East–West contrast is sometimes criticized as relativistic and arbitrary.[48][49][50][page needed] Globalization has spread Western ideas so widely that almost all modern cultures are, to some extent, influenced by aspects of Western culture. Stereotypical views of \"the West\" have been labeled \"Occidentalism\", paralleling \"Orientalism\"—the term for the 19th-century stereotyped views of \"the East\".\nSome philosophers have questioned whether Western culture can be considered a historically sound, unified body of thought.[51] For example, Kwame Anthony Appiah pointed out in 2016 that many of the fundamental influences on Western culture - such as those of Greek philosophy - are also shared by the Islamic world to a certain extent.[51][need quotation to verify] Appiah argues that the origin of the Western and European identity can be traced back to the 8th-century Muslim invasion of Europe via Iberia, when Christians would start to form a common Christian or European identity.[51][need quotation to verify] Contemporary Latin chronicles from Spain referred to the victors in the Frankish victory over the Umayyads at the 732 Battle of Tours as \"Europeans\" according to Appiah, denoting a shared sense of identity.[52]\nA former, now less-acceptable synonym for \"Western civilisation\" was \"the white race\".[53]\nAs Europeans discovered the extra-European world, old concepts adapted. The area that had formerly been considered the Orient (\"the East\") became the Near East as the interests of the European powers interfered with Meiji Japan and Qing China for the first time in the 19th century.[54]\nThus the Sino-Japanese War in 1894–1895 occurred in the \"Far East\" while troubles surrounding the decline of the Ottoman Empire occurred simultaneously in the Near East.[a] The term \"Middle East\" in the mid-19th century included the territory east of the Ottoman Empire but west of China—Greater Persia and Greater India—but is now used synonymously with \"Near East\" in most languages.\n\nHistory[edit]\nFurther information: History of Western civilization\nPart of a series onPhilosophy\n\n Philosophy portal\nContents\nOutline\nLists\nGlossary\nHistory\nCategories\nDisambiguation\n\nshowPhilosophies\nBy period\nAncient\nAncient Egyptian\nAncient Greek\nMedieval\nRenaissance\nModern\nContemporary\nAnalytic\nContinental\n\nBy region\nAfrican\nEgypt\nEthiopia\nSouth Africa\nEastern philosophy\nChinese\nIndian\nIndonesia\nJapan\nKorea\nVietnam\nIndigenous American\nAztec philosophy\nMiddle Eastern philosophy\nIranian\nWestern\nAmerican\nBritish\nFrench\nGerman\nItalian\nRussian\n\nBy religion\nBuddhist\nConfucian\nChristian\nHindu\nIslamic\nJain\nJewish\nTaoist\n\n\nshowBranches\nEpistemology\nEthics\nLogic\nMetaphysics\n\nAesthetics\nEducation\nHistory\nLanguage\nLaw\nMetaphilosophy\nMind\nOntology\nPhenomenology\nPolitical\nReligion\nScience\n\nshowPhilosophers\nAestheticians\nEpistemologists\nEthicists\nLogicians\nMetaphysicians\nPhilosophers of mind\nSocial and political philosophers\nWomen in philosophy\nvte\nThe earliest civilizations which influenced the development of Western culture were those of Mesopotamia; the area of the Tigris–Euphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran: the cradle of civilization.[55][56] Ancient Egypt similarly had a strong influence on Western culture.\nPhoenician mercantilism and the introduction of the Alphabetic script boosted state formation in the Aegean and current-day Italy and current-day Spain, spawning civilizations in the Mediterranean such as Ancient Carthage, Ancient Greece, Etruria, and Ancient Rome.[57]\nThe Greeks contrasted themselves with both their Eastern neighbours (such as the Trojans in Iliad) as well as their Northern neighbours (who they considered barbarians).[citation needed] Concepts of what is the West arose out of legacies of the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire. Later, ideas of the West were formed by the concepts of Latin Christendom and the Holy Roman Empire. What is thought of as Western thought today originates primarily from Greco-Roman and Christian traditions, with varying degrees of influence from the Germanic, Celtic and Slavic peoples, and includes the ideals of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Reformation and the Enlightenment.[58]\n\nThe West of the Mediterranean Region during the Antiquity[edit]\nAlexander the Great\nWhile the concept of a \"West\" did not exist until the emergence of the Roman Republic, the roots of the concept can be traced back to Ancient Greece. Since Homeric literature (the Trojan Wars), through the accounts of the Persian Wars of Greeks against Persians by Herodotus, and right up until the time of Alexander the Great, there was a paradigm of a contrast between Greeks and other civilizations.[59] Greeks felt they were the most civilized and saw themselves (in the formulation of Aristotle) as something between the advanced civilizations of the Near East (who they viewed as soft and slavish) and the wild barbarians of most of Europe to the north. During this period writers like Herodotus and Xenophon would highlight the importance of freedom in the Ancient Greek world, as opposed to the perceived slavery of the so-called barbaric world.[59]\nAlexander\'s conquests led to the emergence of a Hellenistic civilization, representing a synthesis of Greek and Near-Eastern cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean region.[27] The Near-Eastern civilizations of Ancient Egypt and the Levant, which came under Greek rule, became part of the Hellenistic world. The most important Hellenistic centre of learning was Ptolemaic Egypt, which attracted Greek, Egyptian, Jewish, Persian, Phoenician and even Indian scholars.[60] Hellenistic science, philosophy, architecture, literature and art later provided a foundation embraced and built upon by the Roman Empire as it swept up Europe and the Mediterranean world, including the Hellenistic world in its conquests in the 1st century BCE.\nFollowing the Roman conquest of the Hellenistic world, the concept of a \"West\" arose, as there was a cultural divide between the Greek East and Latin West. The Latin-speaking Western Roman Empire consisted of Western Europe and Northwest Africa, while the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire consisted of the Balkans, Asia Minor, Egypt and Levant. The \"Greek\" East was generally wealthier and more advanced than the \"Latin\" West.[citation needed] With the exception of Italia, the wealthiest provinces of the Roman Empire were in the East, particularly Roman Egypt which was the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia.[61][62] Nevertheless, the Celts in the West created some significant literature in the ancient world whenever they were given the opportunity (an example being the poet Caecilius Statius), and they developed a large amount of scientific knowledge themselves (as seen in their Coligny Calendar).\n\nThe Maison Carrée in Nîmes, one of the best-preserved Roman temples\nThe Roman Empire (red) and its client states (pink) at its greatest extent in 117 AD under emperor Trajan\nThe Roman Empire in 330. The area in red shows the zone of influence of the Latin West, while the area in blue shows the eastern Greek part.\nFor about five hundred years, the Roman Empire maintained the Greek East and consolidated a Latin West, but an east–west division remained, reflected in many cultural norms of the two areas, including language. Eventually, the empire became increasingly split into a Western and Eastern part, reviving old ideas of a contrast between an advanced East, and a rugged West.\nFrom the time of Alexander the Great (the Hellenistic period), Greek civilization came in contact with Jewish civilization. Christianity would eventually emerge from the syncretism of Hellenic culture, Roman culture, and Second Temple Judaism, gradually spreading across the Roman Empire and eclipsing its antecedents and influences.[63]\nThe Greek and Roman paganism was gradually replaced by Christianity, first with its legalisation with the Edict of Milan and then the Edict of Thessalonica which made it the State church of the Roman Empire. Catholic Christianity, served as a unifying force in Christian parts of Europe, and in some respects replaced or competed with the secular authorities. The Jewish Christian tradition out of which it had emerged was all but extinguished, and antisemitism became increasingly entrenched or even integral to Christendom.[64][65] Much of art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church.\nIn a broader sense, the Middle Ages, with its fertile encounter between Greek philosophical reasoning and Levantine monotheism was not confined to the West but also stretched into the old East. The philosophy and science of Classical Greece were largely forgotten in Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, other than in isolated monastic enclaves (notably in Ireland, which had become Christian but was never conquered by Rome).[66] The learning of Classical Antiquity was better preserved in the Eastern Roman Empire. Justinian\'s Corpus Juris Civilis Roman civil law code was created in the East in his capital of Constantinople,[67] and that city maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as Venice in the West for centuries. Classical Greek learning was also subsumed, preserved, and elaborated in the rising Eastern world, which gradually supplanted Roman-Byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force. Thus, much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to European civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nThe birth of European West during the Middle Ages[edit]\nMosaic of Justinian I with his court, circa 547–549, Basilica of San Vitale (Ravenna, Italy)[68]\nTwo main symbols of the medieval Western civilization on one picture: the gothic St. Martin\'s cathedral in Spišské Podhradie (Slovakia) and the Spiš Castle behind the cathedral\nStone bas-relief of Jesus, from the Vézelay Abbey (Burgundy, France)\nNotre-Dame, the most iconic Gothic cathedral,[69] built between 1163 and 1345\nThe Medieval West referred specifically to the Catholic \"Latin\" West, also called \"Frankish\" during Charlemagne\'s reign, in contrast to the Orthodox East, where Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire.\nAfter the fall of Rome, much of Greco-Roman art, literature, science and even technology were all but lost in the western part of the old empire. However, this would become the center of a new West. Europe fell into political anarchy, with many warring kingdoms and principalities. Under the Frankish kings, it eventually, and partially, reunified, and the anarchy evolved into feudalism.\nMuch of the basis of the post-Roman cultural world had been set before the fall of the Western Roman Empire, mainly through the integration and reshaping of Roman ideas through Christian thought. The Eastern Orthodox Church founded many cathedrals, monasteries and seminaries, some of which continue to exist today.\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, many of the classical Greek texts were translated into Arabic and preserved in the medieval Islamic world. The Greek classics along with Arabic science, philosophy and technology were transmitted to Western Europe and translated into Latin, sparking the Renaissance of the 12th century and 13th century.[32][33][34]\n\nThomas Aquinas, a Catholic philosopher of the Middle Ages, revived and developed natural law from ancient Greek philosophy.\nMedieval Christianity is credited with creating the first modern universities.[37][38] The Catholic Church established a hospital system in Medieval Europe that vastly improved upon the Roman valetudinaria[70] and Greek healing temples.[71] These hospitals were established to cater to \"particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age,\" according to the historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse.[39] Christianity played a role in ending practices common among pagan societies, such as human sacrifice, slavery,[72] infanticide and polygamy.[73] Francisco de Vitoria, a disciple of Thomas Aquinas and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West\'s democracy and rapid economic development.[74] Joseph Schumpeter, an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the Scholastics, wrote, \"it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the \'founders\' of scientific economics.\"[40]\n\nLater Middle Ages (Rome and Reformation)[edit]\nThe rediscovery of the Justinian Code in Western Europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. In the Catholic or Frankish west, Roman law became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence is found in all Western legal systems, although in different manners and to different extents. The study of canon law, the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. During the Reformation and Enlightenment, the ideas of civil rights, equality before the law, procedural justice, and democracy as the ideal form of society began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern Western culture, particularly in Protestant regions.\nIn the 14th century, starting from Italy and then spreading throughout Europe,[75] there was a massive artistic, architectural, scientific and philosophical revival, as a result of the Christian revival of Greek philosophy, and the long Christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities.[76] This period is commonly referred to as the Renaissance. In the following century, this process was further enhanced by an exodus of Greek Christian priests and scholars to Italian cities such as Florence and Venice after the end of the Byzantine Empire with the fall of Constantinople.\n\nChristopher Columbus arrives at the New World.\nFrom Late Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and onwards, while Eastern Europe was shaped by the Eastern Orthodox Church, Southern and Central Europe were increasingly stabilized by the Catholic Church which, as Roman imperial governance faded from view, was the only consistent force in Western Europe.[77] In 1054 came the Great Schism that, following the Greek East and Latin West divide, separated Europe into religious and cultural regions present to this day. Until the Age of Enlightenment,[78] Christian culture took over as the predominant force in Western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science for many years.[77][79] Movements in art and philosophy, such as the Humanist movement of the Renaissance and the Scholastic movement of the High Middle Ages, were motivated by a drive to connect Catholicism with Greek and Arab thought imported by Christian pilgrims.[80][81][82] However, due to the division in Western Christianity caused by the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment, religious influence—especially the temporal power of the Pope—began to wane.[83][84]\n\nExpansion of the West: the Era of Colonialism (15th–20th centuries)[edit]\nThe United States Constitution\nEarly modern era[edit]\nFrom the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington[85] the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.\nThe Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in European society emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.\nPhilosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant,[86] who influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d\'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.\nCoinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.[87][88][89][90][91][92][excessive citations] While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus\'s De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the \"grand synthesis\" of Newton\'s 1687 Principia.\n\nIndustrial Revolution[edit]\nThe Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools.[93] These transitions began in Great Britain and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.[94]\n\nA Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.[95]\nThe Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[96][97][98] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[99][100][101][102] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[103] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[104] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants[105] and fire.\nThe First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[106][107][108]\n\nPost-Industrial era[edit]\nTendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as New Age movements) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration. Western culture has been heavily influenced by the Renaissance, the Ages of Discovery and Enlightenment and the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions.[109][110]\nIn the 20th century, Christianity declined in influence in many Western countries, mostly in the European Union where some member states have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years,[111] and also elsewhere. Secularism (separating religion from politics and science) increased. Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world, where 70% are Christians.[112]\nThe West went through a series of great cultural and social changes between 1945 and 1980. The emergent mass media (film, radio, television and recorded music) created a global culture that could ignore national frontiers. Literacy became almost universal, encouraging the growth of books, magazines and newspapers. The influence of cinema and radio remained, while televisions became near essentials in every home.\nBy the mid-20th century, Western culture was exported worldwide, and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication (such as transatlantic cable and the radiotelephone) played a decisive role in modern globalization. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of Catholicism, Protestantism, democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to abolish slavery during the 19th century, the first to enfranchise women (beginning in Australasia at the end of the 19th century) and the first to put to use such technologies as steam, electric and nuclear power. The West invented cinema, television, the personal computer, the Internet and video games; developed sports such as soccer, cricket, golf, tennis, rugby, basketball, and volleyball; and transported humans to an astronomical object for the first time with the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon Landing.\n\nArts and humanities[edit]\nSee also: Western canon\nDetail of the Bayeux Tapestry showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left). The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque.\nWhile dance, music, visual art, story-telling, and architecture are human universals, they are expressed in the West in certain characteristic ways.[113]\nIn Western dance, music, plays and other arts, the performers are only very infrequently masked. There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion.\n\nMusic[edit]\nFor modern Western music, see Music industry.\nIn music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,[114] and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.[115]\nThe symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many musical instruments developed in the West have come to see widespread use all over the world; among them are the guitar, violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. In turn, it has been claimed that some European instruments have roots in earlier Eastern instruments that were adopted from the medieval Islamic world.[116] The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also significant musical innovations of the West.\n\n\n\n\nClaudio Monteverdi, 1567–1643\n\n\n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi, 1678–1741\n\n\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel, 1685–1759\n\n\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach, 1685–1750\n\n\n\nFranz Joseph Haydn, 1732–1809\n\n\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756–1791\n\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, 1770–1827\n\n\n\nFrédéric François Chopin, 1810–1849\n\n\n\nFranz Liszt, 1811–1886\n\n\nPainting and photography[edit]\nJan van Eyck, among other renaissance painters, made great advances in oil painting, and perspective drawings and paintings had their earliest practitioners in Florence.[117] In art, the Celtic knot is a very distinctive Western repeated motif. Depictions of the nude human male and female in photography, painting, and sculpture are frequently considered to have special artistic merit. Realistic portraiture is especially valued.\nPhotography and the motion picture as both a technology and basis for entirely new art forms were also developed in the West.\n\n\n\n\nRestoration of a fresco from an Ancient Roman villa bedroom, circa 50-40 BC, dimensions of the room: 265.4 × 334 × 583.9 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City)\n\n\n\nMona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, c. 1503 – 1506, perhaps continuing until circa 1517, oil on poplar panel, 77 cm × 53 cm, Louvre (Paris)\n\n\n\nLas Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, 1656, oil on canvas, 318 cm × 276 cm, El Prado (Madrid)\n\n\n\nDance at Le moulin de la Galette, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1876, oil on canvas, height: 131 cm, Musée d\'Orsay (Paris)\n\n\n\nPhoto of the interior of the apartment of Eugène Atget, taken in 1910 in Paris\n\n\n\nRêverie, by Alphonse Mucha, poster for the publishing house Champenois (1897)\n\n\nDance and performing arts[edit]\nClassical music, opera and ballet: Swan Lake pictured\nThe ballet is a distinctively Western form of performance dance.[118] The ballroom dance is an important Western variety of dance for the elite. The polka, the square dance, the flamenco, and the Irish step dance are very well known Western forms of folk dance.\nGreek and Roman theatre are considered the antecedents of modern theatre, and forms such as medieval theatre, Passion Plays, morality plays, and commedia dell\'arte are considered highly influential. Elizabethan theatre, with playwrights including William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson, is considered one of the most formative and important eras for modern drama.\nThe soap opera, a popular culture dramatic form, originated in the United States first on radio in the 1930s, then a couple of decades later on television. The music video was also developed in the West in the middle of the 20th century. Musical theatre was developed in the West in the 19th and 20th Centuries, from music hall, comic opera, and Vaudeville; with significant contributions from the Jewish diaspora, African-Americans, and other marginalized peoples.[119][120][121]\n\nLiterature[edit]\nThe Divine Comedy is an epic poem by Dante Alighieri. Engraving by Gustave Doré.\nWestern literature encompasses the literary traditions of Europe, as well as North America, Latin America and Oceania.[122]\nWhile epic literary works in verse such as the Mahabharata and Homer\'s Iliad are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose novel as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the West[123] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius\' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world\'s first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.\nThe novel, which made its appearance in the 18th century, is an essentially European creation. Chinese and Japanese literature contain some works that may be thought of as novels, but only the European novel is couched in terms of a personal analysis of personal dilemmas.[113]\nAs in its artistic tradition, European literature pays deep tribute to human suffering.[113] Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera.\nThe validity of reason was postulated in both Christian philosophy and the Greco-Roman classics.[113] Christianity laid a stress on the inward aspects of actions and on motives, notions that were foreign to the ancient world. This subjectivity, which grew out of the Christian belief that man could achieve a personal union with God, resisted all challenges and made itself the fulcrum on which all literary exposition turned, including the 20th–21st century novels.[113]\n\nArchitecture[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The Crusaders, known mostly for fighting over holy land, settled in the Levant and acclimated to the local culture and cuisine. Fulcher of Chartres said \"For we who were occidentals have now become orientals.\" These cultural experiences, carried back to France by notables like Eleanor of Aquitaine influenced Western European foodways. Many Oriental ingredients were relatively new to the Western lands. Sugar, almonds, pistachios, rosewater, and dried citrus fruits were all novelties to the Crusaders who encountered them in Saracen lands. Pepper, ginger and cinnamon were the most widely used spices of the European courts and noble households. By the end of the Middle Ages, cloves, nutmeg, mastic, galingale, and other imported spices had become part of the Western cuisine.[125]\nSaracen influence can be seen in medieval cookbooks. Some recipes retain their Arabic names in Italian translations of the Liber de Coquina. Known as bruet Sarassinois in the cuisine of North France, the concept of sweet and sour sauce is attested to in Greek tradition when Anthimus finishes his stew with vinegar and honey. Saracens combined sweet ingredients like date-juice and honey with pomegranate, lemons and citrus juices, or other sour ingredients. The technique of browning pieces of meat and simmering in liquid with vegetables is used in many recipes from the Baghdad cookery book. The same technique appears in the late-13th century Viandier. Fried pieces of beef simmered in wine with sugar and cloves was called bruet of Sarcynesse in English.[125]\n\nScientific and technological inventions and discoveries[edit]\nMedieval Christians believed that to seek the geometric, physical and mathematical principles that govern the world was to seek and worship God.

The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[132] The percentage of ethnically European Nobel prize winners during the first and second halves of the 20th century were respectively 98 and 94 percent.[133]\nThe West is credited with the development of the steam engine and adapting its use into factories, and for the generation of electric power.[134] The electrical motor, dynamo, transformer, electric light, and most of the familiar electrical appliances, were inventions of the West.[135][136][137][138] The Otto and the Diesel internal combustion engines are products whose genesis and early development were in the West.[139][140] Nuclear power stations are derived from the first atomic pile constructed in Chicago in 1942.[141]\nCommunication devices and systems including the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, communications and navigation satellites, mobile phone, and the Internet were all invented by Westerners.[142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149] The pencil, ballpoint pen, Cathode ray tube, liquid-crystal display, light-emitting diode, camera, photocopier, laser printer, ink jet printer, plasma display screen and World Wide Web were also invented in the West.[150][151][152][153][154]\nUbiquitous materials including aluminum, clear glass, synthetic rubber, synthetic diamond and the plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene were discovered and developed or invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them.[155][156][157][158][159][160][161][162]\nThe transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, first programming language and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship\'s chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.[citation needed]\nIn medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, computed tomography, positron emission tomography and medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry, including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay, were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, the electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs, were first used to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.[citation needed]\n\nEuler is widely regarded to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history.\nIn mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory, abstract algebra and topology were developed by Westerners.[163][164][165][166][167][168][169] In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creations of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb\'s law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm\'s law (1827), and Maxwell\'s equations (1871). The atom, nucleus, electron, neutron and proton were all unveiled by Westerners.[citation needed]\nThe world\'s most widely adopted system of measurement, the International System of Units, derived from the metric system, was first developed in France and evolved through contributions from various Westerners.[170][171]\nIn business, economics, and finance, double entry bookkeeping, credit cards, and the charge card were all first used in the West.[172][173]\nWesterners are also known for their explorations of the globe and outer space. The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first Moon landing (1969).[174][175] The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1\'s passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons\' flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.[176][177][178][179][180]\n\nMedia[edit]\nMain article: Western media\nThe roots of modern-day Western mass media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout wealthy European cities. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.[181]\nIn the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the discoveries arising from trade and travel, navigation to the New World, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in European society.[182]\nAfter the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the United States launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in US in 1975.[183]\nBeginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).[184]\n\nReligion[edit]\nMain article: Western religions\nThe native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous – however, they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion – likewise for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.\nWestern culture at some level is influenced by the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman traditions.[185] These cultures had a number of similarities, such as a common emphasis on the individual, but they also embody fundamentally conflicting worldviews. For example, in Judaism and Christianity, God is the ultimate authority, while Greco-Roman tradition considers the ultimate authority to be reason. Christian attempts to reconcile these frameworks were responsible for the preservation of Greek philosophy.[185] Historically, Europe has been the center and cradle of Christian civilization.[186][187][188][189]\nAccording to a survey by Pew Research Center from 2011, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world where 70–84% are Christians,[112] According to this survey, 76% of Europeans described themselves as Christians,[112][190][191] and about 86% of the Americas\' population identified themselves as Christians,[192] (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America).[193] 73% in Oceania self-identify as Christian, and 76% in South Africa are Christian.[112]\n2012 Eurobarometer polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 found that Christianity was the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population.[194] Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU citizens, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%.[195] Non-believers/Agnostics account for 16%,[194] atheists account for 7%,[194] and Muslims account for 2%.[194] According to Scholars, in 2017, Europe\'s population was 77.8% Christian (up from 74.9% 1970),[196][197] these changes were largely result of the collapse of Communism and switching to Christianity in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.[196]\nAt the same there has been an increase in the share of agnostic or atheist residents in Europe; these made up about 18% of the European population in 2012.[198] In particular, over half of the populations of the Czech Republic (79% of the population was agnostic, atheist or irreligious), the United Kingdom (52%), Germany (25–33%),[199] France (30–35%)[200][201][202] and the Netherlands (39–44%) are agnostic or atheist.\nAs in other areas, the Jewish diaspora and Judaism exist in the Western world.\nThere are also small but increasing numbers of people across the Western world who seek to revive the indigenous religions of their European ancestors; such groups include Germanic, Roman, Hellenic, Celtic, Slavic, and polytheistic reconstructionist movements. Likewise, Wicca, New Age spirituality and other neo-pagan belief systems enjoy notable minority support in Western states.\n\nSport[edit]\nMain article: Western sports\nThe Bull-Leaping Fresco from the Great Palace at Knossos, Crete. Sport has been an important part of Western culture since Classical Antiquity.\nBaron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, and considered father of the modern Olympic Games\nSince classical antiquity, sport has been an important facet of Western cultural expression.[203][204]\nA wide range of sports was already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympic games were held at Athens in 1896.\nThe Romans built immense structures such as the amphitheatres to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of classical antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin.\nThe sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.[205]\nJousting and hunting were popular sports in the European Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II\'s banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery.[206]\nThe Industrial Revolution that began in Great Britain in the 18th century brought increased leisure time, leading to more opportunities for citizens to participate in athletic activities and also follow spectator sports. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in the United Kingdom during the 19th century and obtained global prominence; these include ping pong, modern tennis, association football, netball and rugby.[207]\nFootball (or soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing states, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among New Zealand, Australia, England, and South Africa.\nAustralian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby, evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games are known as \"football\" were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the \"Father of American football\". Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States. Volleyball was created in Holyoke, Massachusetts, a city directly north of Springfield, in 1895.\n\nThemes and traditions[edit]\nA Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas\nWestern culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:[citation needed]\n\nGreco-Roman classic letters, arts, architecture, philosophical and cultural tradition, which include the influence of preeminent authors and philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Homer, Virgil, and Cicero, as well as a long mythologic tradition.\nChristian ethical, philosophical, and mythological tradition, stemming largely from the Christian Bible, particularly the New Testament Gospels.[208][209][210]\nMonasteries, schools, libraries, books, book making, universities, teaching, education, and lecture halls.\nA tradition of the importance of the rule of law.\nSecular humanism, rationalism and Enlightenment thought. This set the basis for a new critical attitude and open questioning of religion, favouring freethinking and questioning of the church as an authority, which resulted in open-minded and reformist ideals inside, such as liberation theology, which partly adopted these currents, and secular and political tendencies such as separation of church and state (sometimes termed laicism), agnosticism and atheism.\nGeneralized usage of some form of the Latin or Greek alphabet, and derived forms, such as Cyrillic, used by those southern and eastern Slavic countries of Christian Orthodox tradition, historically under the Byzantine Empire and later within the Russian czarist or the Soviet area of influence. Other variants of the Latin or Greek alphabets are found in the Gothic and Coptic alphabets, which historically superseded older scripts, such as runes, and the Egyptian Demotic and Hieroglyphic systems.\nNatural law, human rights, constitutionalism, parliamentarism (or presidentialism) and formal liberal democracy in recent times—prior to the 19th century, most Western governments were still monarchies.\nA large influence, in modern times, of many of the ideals and values developed and inherited from Romanticism.\nAn emphasis on, and use of, science as a means of understanding the natural world and humanity\'s place in it.\nMore pronounced use and application of innovation and scientific developments, as well as a more rational approach to scientific progress (what has been known as the scientific method).\nSee also[edit]\n\nSociety portalEurope portal\n\nAtlanticism\nChristendom\nClassical tradition\nCulture during the Cold War\nEastern world\nEastern culture\nEuropean diaspora\nGreco-Roman world\nWestern religion\nWesternization\nWestern values\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ British archaeologist D.G.

With the rise of Christianity during the Late Roman Empire, however, peoples in Europe began to identify themselves as part of a civilization different from others, such as that of Islam, leading to a concept of a Western civilization different from other civilizations. In the fifteenth century, Renaissance intellectuals began to identify this civilization not only with Christianity but also with the intellectual and political achievements of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Important to the development of the idea of a distinct Western civilization were encounters with other peoples. Between 700 and 1500, encounters with the world of Islam helped define the West. But after 1500, as European ships began to move into other parts of the world, encounters with peoples in Asia, Africa, and the Americas not only had an impact on the civilizations found there but also affected how people in the West defined themselves. At the same time, as they set up colonies, Europeans began to transplant a sense of Western identity to other areas of the world, especially North America and parts of Latin America, that have come to be considered part of Western civilization.

In general, researchers consider that it has three main components, in Europe, North America and Latin America. [...] However, Latin America has followed a quite different development path from Europe and North America. Although it is a scion of European civilization, it also incorporates more elements of indigenous American civilizations compared to those of North America and Europe. It also currently has had a more corporatist and authoritarian culture. Both Europe and North America felt the effects of Reformation and combination of Catholic and Protestant cultures. Historically, Latin America has been only Catholic, although this may be changing.

(formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\nFor most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world\'s largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024.[6][7] In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[8][failed verification] As of 2023[update], Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[9] the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world.[10] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak\'s Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company\'s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs\'s return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors\' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world\'s most valuable brands.\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[11]\n\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n1976–1980: Founding and incorporation\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\nIn 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in Jobs\'s parents\' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[12] Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\",[13] although they moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[14]\nThe Apple I is Apple\'s first product, designed by Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without the required keyboard, monitor, power supply, and the optional case.\nThe Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[12][15] The company\'s first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[16] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[17]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[18] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[19] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[20][21]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[22]\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[23][24] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[25] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[26] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to US$118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[27]\nThe Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[28] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, which were superseded by the 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[29][30]\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[29] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[29] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[31][32]\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[24] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[33] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share[34] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[33][34]\n\n1980–1990: Success with Macintosh\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\nThe Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nIn December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC, where they observed the Xerox Alto, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC\'s technology, leading to Apple\'s option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple\'s products, starting with the Apple Lisa. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company\'s Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[35] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company\'s revenue.[36]\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[37] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a US$1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[38] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple\'s success[39] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[40] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[41]\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[42]: 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[43] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[44] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[45]\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley\'s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[46] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple\'s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[46] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[47] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple\'s treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[36][48][49] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[48] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[21] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures.[50]\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[51] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[52]\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[53] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée\'s slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[54]: 79–80 \nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company\'s history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple\'s stock price.[54]: 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[55] Gassée left the company later that year.[56]\n\n1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[57] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[58] For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[59]The PenLite is Apple\'s first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[60]\nThe success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models.[61]\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[62] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[63]\nApple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including QuickTake digital cameras, PowerCD portable CD audio players, speakers, the Pippin video game console, the eWorld online service, and Apple Interactive Television Box. Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley\'s unrealistic market forecasts.[64]\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[65] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.[66] The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed.\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple\'s reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[67]\nUnder Spindler, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP\'s performance and Apple\'s software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola\'s PowerPC processor.[68]\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[69]\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO, who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[70]\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach.[71] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that year, Copland in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of Apple\'s $125 million offer.[72]\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[73] Apple\'s board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, and retained Steve Jobs.[74]\n\n1997–2007: Return to profitability\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[75] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio\'s resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.[76] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software.[77] This was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case.[78] Around then, Jobs donated Apple\'s internal library and archives to Stanford University, to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past.[79][80] He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[81] On November 10, 1997, the Apple Store website launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dell\'s success.[82]\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit.[76]\n\niMaciBookPower Macintosh G3PowerBook G3\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success with 800,000 units sold in its first five months[83] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[84] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive, who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple\'s product design.[85][86]\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs\'s strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[87]\nAround then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired Macromedia\'s Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April 1999.[88] Key Grip\'s development also led to Apple\'s release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[89] Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro, and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[89] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, and simplified the user interface and added CD burning.[90]\nIn 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements.\nFirst, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. To aid migration from Mac OS 9, the new operating system ran legacy applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[91]\nIn May 2001, the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California,[92][93] offering an improved presentation of the company\'s products.[94] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[95] but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[96]\nOn October 23, 2001, the iPod portable digital audio player debuted. The product was first sold on November 10, 2001, and was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[97]\nIn 2003, the iTunes Store was introduced with music downloads for 99¢ a song and iPod integration. It quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[98] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world\'s largest music retailer.[99]\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for its advanced digital compositing application Shake,[100] and Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple\'s consumer-level GarageBand application.[101] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[102]\n\nThe MacBook Pro is Apple\'s first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[103] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel\'s Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[103] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\nApple\'s success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple\'s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell\'s market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell\'s CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n2007–2011: Success with mobile devices\nThe newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\nIn an article posted on Apple\'s website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management, thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI\'s catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May 2010, Apple\'s market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new design with an exposed stainless steel frame as the phone\'s antenna system. Later that year, Apple again refreshed the iPod line by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs\'s day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple\'s previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple\'s chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs\'s death.[134]\n\n2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple\'s Phil Schiller introduced iBook\'s Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad\'s 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple\'s biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple\'s rising stock price increased the company\'s market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung\'s request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make US$280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\nIn May 2014, Apple confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine\'s audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for US$3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple\'s retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple\'s \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple\'s history.[151]\n\nApple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch called the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\nIn January 2016, Apple announced that over one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\nOn June 6, 2016, Fortune released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with US$233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year\'s list.[156]\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Toward the end of the year, TechCrunch reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple US$400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America\'s minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, and a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook\'s leadership.[164]\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple\'s share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of US$2 trillion.[165]\n\nMacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple\'s processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Apple\'s effort to develop its own chips left it better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased profitability, with sales of M1-based Mac computers rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called \'Apple Pay Later\' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\nIn November 2023, Apple agreed to a $25 million settlement in a U.S. Department of Justice case that alleged Apple was discriminating against U.S. citizens in hiring. Apple created jobs that were not listed online and required paper submission to apply for, while advertising these jobs to foreign workers as part of recruitment for PERM.[179]\nIn January 2024, Apple announced compliance with the European Union\'s competition law, with major changes to the App Store and other services, effective March 7. This enables iOS users in the 27-nation bloc to use alternative app stores, and alternative payment methods within apps. This adds a menu in Safari for downloading alternative browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox.[180]\n\nProducts\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\nMac\nMain article: Mac (computer)\nMacBook Air with M2 chipiMac with M1 chip\nMacintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple\'s line of personal computers that use the company\'s proprietary macOS operating system. Personal computers were Apple\'s original business line, but as of the end of 2023[update] they account for only about eight percent of the company\'s revenue.[1]\nThere are six Macintosh computer families in production:\n\niMac: Consumer all-in-one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.\nMac Mini: Consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in 2005.\nMacBook Pro: Professional notebook, introduced in 2006.\nMac Pro: Professional workstation, introduced in 2006.\nMacBook Air: Consumer ultra-thin notebook, introduced in 2008.\nMac Studio: Professional small form-factor workstation, introduced in 2022.\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\niPhone\nMain article: iPhone\niPhone 15 (left) and iPhone 15 Pro (right)\nThe iPhone is Apple\'s line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released every year. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\niOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world\'s most valuable publicly traded companies.[181] As of the end of 2023[update], the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company\'s revenue.[1]\n\niPad\nMain article: iPad\nThe iPad is Apple\'s line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad\'s performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[182][183]\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[184] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[185] and accounted for seven percent of the company\'s revenue as of the end of 2023[update].[1]\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\nOther products\nAirPods MaxApple Watch Ultra\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[186] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones, HomePod smart speakers, and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\nAs of the end of 2023[update], this broad line of products comprises about ten percent of the company\'s revenues.[1]\n\nServices\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\nAs of the end of 2023[update], services comprise about 22% of the company\'s revenue.[1] In 2019, Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[187]\n\n\nMarketing\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc.. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to  incorporate it into this article\'s main text, or the main text of another article. (January 2023)\nBranding\nThe first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[188]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company\'s name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[189] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[190] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended when they settled their lawsuit in 2007.[191]\nApple\'s first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff\'s \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[192] On August 27, 1999,[193] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[194]\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[195] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple\'s products.[85]\nFortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[196] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world\'s most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group\'s \"Best Global Brands\" report.[197] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world\'s most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[198]\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[199][200] In February 2023, that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[201][202]\n\nAdvertising\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\nApple\'s first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[203] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[204] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[205] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[206] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[207]\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts toward effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[208] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[209] Apple\'s product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[210] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[210]\n\nStores\nMain article: Apple Store\nApple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\nCustomers visit the Genius Bar at Apple\'s Regent Street store in 2006.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[92] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[94] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company\'s products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[94] Jobs relaunched Apple\'s online store in 1997,[211] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[92] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[95] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[95]\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[96] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[212] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, and changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[213]\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[94] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores\' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[214] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[215] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[212] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[212] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[212]\n\nMarket power\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[216]\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued both Apple and Google after Fortnite was removed from Apple\'s and Google\'s App stores. The lawsuits came after Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system that bypassed the fees that Apple and Google had imposed.[217] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[218] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps and privacy rule changes.[219] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it\'s going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[220]\n\nPrivacy\nPRISM is a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple.[221]\nApple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[222] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users\' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[223] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user\'s local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple\'s iCloud storage system.[224] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[225] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[226]\nHowever, Apple has aided law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users\' devices,[227] and the company\'s commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[228]\nWith Apple\'s release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, called \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users\' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. After Facebook\'s measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[229]\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[230]\nIreland\'s Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU\'s GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[231]\nIn December 2019, security researcher Brian Krebs discovered that the iPhone 11 Pro would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that \"It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings.\"[232]\nApple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultra-wideband regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that \"the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data.\" Will Strafach, an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall, confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device\'s location.[233][234]\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[235]\n\nCorporate affairs\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\nBusiness trends\nThe key trends for Apple are, as of each financial year ending September 24:[236][237]\n\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n\nRevenue figures\n\n\nTotal revenue[a] (US$ b)\n\n108\n\n156\n\n170\n\n182\n\n233\n\n215\n\n229\n\n265\n\n260\n\n274\n\n365\n\n394\n\n383\n\n\n- iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n\n45.9\n\n78.6\n\n91.2\n\n101\n\n155\n\n136\n\n139\n\n164\n\n142\n\n137\n\n191\n\n205\n\n200\n\n\n- Mac revenue (US$ b)\n\n21.7\n\n23.2\n\n21.4\n\n24.0\n\n25.4\n\n22.8\n\n25.5\n\n25.1\n\n25.7\n\n28.6\n\n35.1\n\n40.1\n\n29.3\n\n\n- iPad revenue (US$ b)\n\n19.1\n\n30.9\n\n31.9\n\n30.2\n\n23.2\n\n20.6\n\n18.8\n\n18.3\n\n21.2\n\n23.7\n\n31.8\n\n29.2\n\n28.3\n\n\n- Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n\n11.9\n\n10.7\n\n10.1\n\n8.3\n\n10.0\n\n11.1\n\n12.8\n\n17.3\n\n24.4\n\n30.6\n\n38.3\n\n41.2\n\n39.8\n\n\n- Services revenue (US$ b)\n\n9.3\n\n12.8\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n19.9\n\n24.3\n\n32.7\n\n39.7\n\n46.2\n\n53.7\n\n68.4\n\n78.1\n\n85.2\n\n\nNon-revenue figures\n\n\nNet profit[b] (US$ b)\n\n25.9\n\n41.7\n\n37.0\n\n39.5\n\n53.3\n\n45.6\n\n48.3\n\n59.3\n\n55.2\n\n57.4\n\n94.6\n\n99.8\n\n96.9\n\n\nNumber of employees (k, FTE)\n\n60.4\n\n72.8\n\n80.3\n\n92.6\n\n110\n\n116\n\n123\n\n132\n\n137\n\n147\n\n154\n\n164\n\n161\n\n\nReferences\n\n[238]\n\n[239]\n\n[240]\n\n[241]\n\n[242]\n\n[243]\n\n[244]\n\n[245]\n\n[246]\n\n[247]\n\n[248]\n\n[249]\n\n[250]\n\nLeadership\nSenior management\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[251]\n\nTim Cook (chief executive officer)\nJeff Williams (chief operating officer)\nLuca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\nKatherine L.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple\'s informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[253] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[254] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[255]\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs\'s involvement often took longer than others.[256]\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[257] Steve Capps,[258] Rod Holt,[257] Alan Kay,[259][260] Guy Kawasaki,[259][261] Al Alcorn,[262] Don Norman,[259] Rich Page,[257] Steve Wozniak,[257] and Phil Schiller.[263]\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[needs update] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[264] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[254][265] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple\'s official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[266] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[267]\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[268] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[269]\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[270]\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[271]\nIn 2023, Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple\'s Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet\'s X \"moonshot factory\".[272]\n\nOffices\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\nApple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.\'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California\'s Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\nThe original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[273] The Apple Campus was the company\'s headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[274] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[275]\nApple\'s headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[276] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple\'s first location outside of the United States.[277] Apple\'s international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[278]\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[279] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado; Culver City, California; Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[280]\n\nLitigation\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[281] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include Apple v. Samsung, Apple v. Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v. Apple Computer. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[282] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter\'s products infringe on Nokia\'s patents.[283] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple\'s remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[284] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[285]\n\nFinances\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\nApple is the world\'s largest technology company by revenue, the world\'s largest technology company by total assets,[286] and the world\'s second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[287]\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[288] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[289]\nThe company\'s worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[290] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[291] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[292]\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[293]\nOn April 30, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[294] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[295]\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[296][297] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[298]\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[299]\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple\'s second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[300]\n\nTaxes\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to The New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[301][302]\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[303] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[304]\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company\'s offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[305] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple\'s retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[306]\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company\'s tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[307]\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[308] In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[309]\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple\'s use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the commission had provided insufficient evidence.[310][311] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following eight years.[312]\n\n\nApple\'s Effective Tax Rate in %[236][237]\n\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\n28\n\n30\n\n25\n\n26\n\n28\n\n26\n\n29\n\n30\n\n30\n\n31.8\n\n24.4\n\n24.2\n\n25.2\n\n26.2\n\n26.1\n\n26.4\n\n25.6\n\n24.6\n\n18.3\n\n15.9\n\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n14.4\n\n13.3\n\n16.2\n\n14.7\n\nCharity\nApple is a partner of Product Red, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[313] generating more than US$20 million,[314] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[315]\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[316] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[317] and for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[318] The company has used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[319] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[320] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[321] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[322] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[323]\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF\'s Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF\'s conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[324]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple\'s CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[325]\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to help combat institutional racism worldwide after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.[326][327][328] In June 2023, Apple announced doubling this and then distributed more than $200 million to support organizations focused on education, economic growth, and criminal justice. Half is philanthropic grants and half is centered on equity.[326]\n\nEnvironment\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\nThis section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to  incorporate it into this article\'s main text, or the main text of another article. (January 2023)\nApple Energy\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple\'s solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[329] Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[330] Apple\'s North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources.[331]\n\nEnergy and resources\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[332] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[333]\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[334][335] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company\'s power came from clean renewable sources.[336]\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple\'s commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[337]\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple\'s data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple\'s global operations run on renewable energy.[338] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[339] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple\'s data centers recycle water 35 times,[340] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[341]\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple\'s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple\'s worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company\'s efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[342] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company\'s installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple\'s Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company\'s energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple\'s Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[343]\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple\'s efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[344] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL\'s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[345]\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[346]\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[347]\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple\'s carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[348][349]\nIn Russia, in 2022, the company\'s revenue amounted to 85 billion rubles.[7]\nIn 2023, Apple announced it was dropping leather from its product lines, citing the material\'s \"significant carbon footprint\".[350] The move earned Apple a 2023 Company of the Year award from PETA.[351]\n\nToxins\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[352] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[353] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[354][355][356][357] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[358] In June 2009, Apple\'s iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[354][359] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product\'s respective regulatory category.[354][360]\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace\'s Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[361] Greenpeace praised Apple\'s sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[362] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[363]\n\nGreen bonds\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[364]\n\nSupply chain\nMain article: Apple supply chainThis section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to  incorporate it into this article\'s main text, or the main text of another article. (January 2023)\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by The New York Times, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \'Made in the USA\' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[365]\nThe company\'s manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple\'s profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook\'s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company\'s operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[366][367]\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[368] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[369] The following December, Apple\'s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told CNBC that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We\'re not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We\'re thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[370]\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[371] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[372] but also Brazil,[373] and India.[374]\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple\'s smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[375] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC\'s total income in 2021.[376] Apple\'s Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[377] from the A11 bionic onward, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC.[378]\nDuring the Mac\'s early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[379] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple\'s adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[380]\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[381] India\'s requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[382] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[383] In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[384] and in May, the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[385] while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[386] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[387] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[388]\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by The Wall Street Journal to gain an additional foothold in Apple\'s supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[389]\n\nWorker organizations\nMain article: Apple and unions\nThis section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to  incorporate it into this article\'s main text, or the main text of another article. (January 2023)\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers\' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[390][391]\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[392] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker\'s rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[393] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers\' child labor practices in China had worsened.[394]\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[395] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world\'s largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[395][396][397] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[398] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n[Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[399]\nThe statement was released after the results from the company\'s probe into its suppliers\' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple\'s own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[399] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[400]\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[401] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[402] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[403] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[404]\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, after Apple\'s promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. The BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], but Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[400]\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple\'s iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[405]\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn\'s managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[406]\n\nSee also\nList of Apple Inc. media events\nPixar\nNotes\n\n\n^ \"Net sales\"\n\n^ \"Net income\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c d e f \"Apple 10-K Report FY2023\".

Chocolate (disambiguation).\n\n\nChocolateChocolate in its most common forms: powder and barsRegion or stateMesoamericaMain ingredientsCocoa beanVariationsChocolate liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa solids, solid chocolate Cookbook: Chocolate  Media: Chocolate\nChocolate, or cocoa, is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador.[1] Later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.[2]\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, or added vegetable oils and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns.[3][4]  A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, the absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[3]\n\n\nEtymology\nMaya glyph for cocoa\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[5] dates to 1000 BCE or earlier.[5] The word \"chocolate\" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[6] The word entered Spanish from the word chocolātl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, \"cocoa water\". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for \"faeces\") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, \"hot\", with the Nahuatl word atl, \"water\".[7] A widely cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning \"bitter drink\" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning \"beaten drink\", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[8] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[9]  The term \"chocolatier\", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[10]\n\nHistory\nSee also: History of chocolate\nSouth America\nThe cocoa bean was first domesticated at least 5,300 years ago, in equatorial South America from the Santa Ana-La Florida (SALF) site in what is present-day southeast Ecuador (Zamora-Chinchipe Province) by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture, before being introduced in Mesoamerica.[1][11]\n\nMesoamerican usage\nImage from a Maya ceramic depicting a container of frothed chocolate\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BCE.[12] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier to 1900 BCE.[13][12] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage; the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[14]\n\nMexica. Man Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440–1521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum.\nAn early Classic-period (460–480 CE) Maya tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, which suggests that the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 CE.[15] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated that chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes in addition to everyday life.[16] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards[17] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[18]\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs had gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and had adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[19] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[20] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chili pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[19] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed \"tribute\".[19] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[21] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans[22] and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[23]\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood.[24][25]\nThe Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: \"because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.\"[25]\n\nAdaptation outside Mesoamerica\nSee also: History of chocolate in Spain\n\"Traités nouveaux & curieux du café du thé et du chocolate\", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 (\"New and curious treatises of coffee, tea and chocolate\")\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[19] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew stole a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[26] Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[15][27] José de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico... Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards... because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala... It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \"chocolate\", which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[28]\nChocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas. The morning chocolate by Pietro Longhi; Venice, 1775–1780\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[26] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[19] Agustín Farfán, a former court physician and Friar in New Spain, in Tratado Breve de Medicina first  introduced cocoa, derived from cacao (native to New Spain), to Europe with a medical use (digestion). Through the 17th and 18th centuries, doctors affirmed the healthy effects of chocolate, consequently boosting the import of chocolate and introducing its consumption in the Europe.[29]\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclopédie states, \"The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach\", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as \"healthy chocolate\".[30] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[31] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[19]\n\nSilver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert a moulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714–15 (Victoria and Albert Museum)\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[19] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[32]\nIn 1729, the first water-powered machinery to grind cocoa beans was developed by Charles Churchman and his son Walter in Bristol, England.[33] In 1761, Joseph Fry and his partner John Vaughan bought Churchman\'s premises, founding Fry\'s.[33] The same year, Fry and Vaughan also acquired their own patent for a water-powered machine that could grind the cocoa beans to a fine powder and thus produce a superior cocoa drink.[34] In 1795, chocolate production entered the Industrial era when Fry\'s, under the founder\'s son Joseph Storrs Fry, used a Watt steam engine to ground cocoa beans.[33] The Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. Founded by Dr. James Baker and John Hannon in Boston in 1765, the business is still in operation.[35][36]\n\nSolid chocolate\nDespite the drink remaining the traditional form of consumption for a long time, solid chocolate was increasingly consumed since the 18th century.[37][38] Tablets, facilitating the consumption of chocolate under its solid form, have been produced since the early 19th century. Cailler (1819)[39] and Menier (1836)[40] are early examples. In 1830, chocolate is paired with hazelnuts, an innovation due to Kohler.[41]\n\nDutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten invented \"Dutch cocoa\" by treating cocoa mass with alkaline salts to reduce the natural bitterness without adding sugar or milk to get usable cocoa powder.\nMeanwhile, new processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[19] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate, allowing the mass-production of both pure cocoa butter and cocoa powder.[26]\n\nThe first mass-produced chocolate bar, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, was produced by Fry\'s in 1866.[42]\nKnown as \"Dutch cocoa\", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate more easily moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22][33]  Subsequently, in 1866 his chocolate factory, Fry\'s, launched the first mass-produced chocolate bar, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, and they became very popular.[42] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor.[19][26] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[43]\nBesides Nestlé, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury of Birmingham was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[19] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[44] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nTypes\nMain article: Types of chocolate\nBarks made of different varieties of chocolate\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called \"baking chocolate\", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nEating chocolate\nThe traditional types of chocolate are dark, milk and white. All of them contain cocoa butter, which is the ingredient defining the physical properties of chocolate (consistency and melting temperature). Plain (or dark) chocolate, as it name suggests, is a form of chocolate that is similar to pure cocoa liquor, although is usually made with a slightly higher proportion of cocoa butter.[45] It is simply defined by its cocoa percentage. In milk chocolate, the non-fat cocoa solids are partly or mostly replaced by milk solids.[46] In white chocolate, they are all replaced by milk solids, hence its ivory color.[47]\nOther forms of eating chocolate exist, these include raw chocolate (made with unroasted beans) and ruby chocolate. An additional popular form of eating chocolate, gianduja, is made by incorporating nut paste (typically hazelnut) to the chocolate paste.[48]\n\nOther types\nOther types of chocolate are used in baking and confectionery. These include baking chocolate (often unsweetened), couverture chocolate (used for coating), compound chocolate (a lower-cost alternative) and modeling chocolate. Modeling chocolate is a chocolate paste made by melting chocolate and combining it with corn syrup, glucose syrup, or golden syrup.[49]\n\nProduction\nSee also: Children in cocoa production and Cocoa production in Ivory Coast\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from Côte d\'Ivoire,[50] where, as of 2007[update], child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[51][52] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[53] As of 2007[update] in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[54] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[55] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[56]\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called \"chocolate\", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[53]\n\nGenome\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[57] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley, are conducting genomic research in 2017–18 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[58]\n\nCacao varieties\nMain article: Cocoa bean § Varieties\nToasted cocoa beans at a chocolate workshop at the La Chonita Hacienda in Tabasco\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4–8 m tall (15–26 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means \"food of the gods\".[59] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15–30 cm (6–12 in) long and 8–10 cm (3–4 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20° of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 °C (70 to 90 °F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 °C (59 °F).[60]\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nProcessing \nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or low sugar content, reducing the ultimate flavor.\n\nMicrobial fermentation\n\"Dancing the cocoa\", Trinidad, c. 1957\nThe beans (which are sterile within their pods) and their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins to ferment. Micro-organisms, present  naturally in the environment, ferment the pectin-containing material. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. In some cocoa-producing regions an association between filamentous fungi and bacteria (called \"cocobiota\") acts to produce metabolites beneficial to human health when consumed.[61] The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, that eventually provide the chocolate taste.[62]\nAfter fermentation, the beans must be dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[63] In some growing regions (for example, Tobago), the dried beans are then polished for sale by \"dancing the cocoa\": spreading the beans onto a floor, adding oil or water, and shuffling the beans against each other using bare feet.[64]\n\nMoist incubation\nIn this alternative process, the beans are dried without fermentation. The nibs are then removed and hydrated in an acidic solution. They are heated for 72 hours and dried again. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the incubated chocolate had higher levels of Strecker aldehydes, and lower levels of pyrazines.[65][66]\n\nGrinding and blending\nMain article: Types of chocolate\nA chocolate mill (right) grinds and heats cocoa kernels into chocolate liquor. A melanger (left) mixes milk, sugar, and other ingredients into the liquor.\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. The nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate liquor.[67] The liquor can be further processed into cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[68]\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own \"signature\" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[69] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[69]\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[70] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as \"chocolate\" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[71][72]\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as \"family milk chocolate\" rather than \"milk chocolate\" if it contains 20% milk.[73]\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[74] a \"chocolate product\" is a food product that is sourced from at least one \"cocoa product\" and contains at least one of the following: \"chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate\". A \"cocoa product\" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains \"cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder\".\n\nConching and refining\nMain article: Conching\nA longitudinal conche\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 μm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 °C (113 to 122 °F) until final processing.[75]\n\nTempering\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[76][77] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[76][78] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form, Type V, is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\n\n\nCrystal\n\nMelting temp.\n\nNotes\n\n\nI\n\n17 °C (63 °F)\n\nSoft, crumbly, melts too easily\n\n\nII\n\n21 °C (70 °F)\n\nSoft, crumbly, melts too easily\n\n\nIII\n\n26 °C (79 °F)\n\nFirm, poor snap, melts too easily\n\n\nIV\n\n28 °C (82 °F)\n\nFirm, good snap, melts too easily\n\n\nV\n\n34 °C (93 °F)\n\nGlossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 °C)\n\n\nVI\n\n36 °C (97 °F)\n\nHard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[79]\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[80]\nMaking chocolate considered \"good\" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\nChocolate cubes, pistoles and callets\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 °C (113 °F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[76][78] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 °C (81 °F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal \"seeds\" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 °C (88 °F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid \"seed\" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal \"seeds\"; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to \"inoculate\" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to \"seed\" the molten chocolate).\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50 °C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30 °C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.\n\nShaping\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[81]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\nPistoles, callets and fèves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and Fève (trinket))\nChocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\nStorage\nPackaged chocolate in the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company is stored in controlled conditions.\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 °C (59 and 63 °F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of \"blooming\" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[82]\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 °C (75 °F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 °C (59 °F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste is unaffected.[83][84][85] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[86]\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[87]\n\nCandies, milk chocolateNutritional value per 100 g (3.5 oz)Energy2,240 kJ (540 kcal)Carbohydrates59.4Sugars51.5 gDietary fiber3.4 g\nFat29.7\nProtein7.6 g\nVitaminsQuantity %DV†Vitamin A195 IUThiamine (B1)8% 0.1 mgRiboflavin (B2)23% 0.3 mgNiacin (B3)3% 0.4 mgPantothenic acid (B5)10% 0.5 mgVitamin B60% 0.0 mgFolate (B9)3% 11 μgVitamin B1229% 0.7 μgCholine8% 46.1 mgVitamin C0% 0 mgVitamin E3% 0.5 mgVitamin K5% 5.7 μg\nMineralsQuantity %DV†Calcium15% 189 mgIron13% 2.4 mgMagnesium15% 63 mgManganese22% 0.5 mgPhosphorus17% 208 mgPotassium12% 372 mgSelenium8% 4.5 μgSodium3% 79 mgZinc21% 2.3 mg\nOther constituentsQuantityWater1.5 gCaffeine20 mgCholesterol23 mgTheobromine205 mg\nLink to USDA Database entry†Percentages estimated using US recommendations for adults,[88] except for potassium, which is estimated based on expert recommendation from the National Academies.[89]\nNutrition\nOne hundred grams of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10–19% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nAssorted chocolates\nHealth effects\nPhytochemicals\nSee also: Polyphenol § Research\nChocolate contains polyphenols, especially flavan-3-ols (catechins) and smaller amounts of other flavonoids.[90][91] It also contains alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine, [92] which are under study for their potential effects in the body.[93]\n\nLead\nIt is unlikely that chocolate consumption in small amounts causes lead poisoning. Some studies have shown that lead may bind to cocoa shells, and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process.[94] One study showed the mean lead level in milk chocolate candy bars was 0.027 μg lead per gram of candy;[94] another study found that some chocolate purchased at U.S. supermarkets contained up to 0.965 μg per gram, close to the international (voluntary) standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans, which is 1 μg of lead per gram.[95] In 2006, the U.S. FDA lowered by one-fifth the amount of lead permissible in candy, but compliance is only voluntary.[96] Studies concluded that \"children, who are big consumers of chocolates, may be at risk of exceeding the daily limit of lead; whereas one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit. \"Moreover chocolate may not be the only source of lead in their nutrition\"[97] and \"chocolate might be a significant source of cadmium and lead ingestion, particularly for children.\"[98] According to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is ≤ 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[94] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of now unused leaded gasoline).[94][99]\n\nCadmium\nThe European Food Safety Authority recommended a tolerable weekly intake for cadmium of 2.5 micrograms per kg of body weight for Europeans, indicating that consuming chocolate products caused exposure of about 4% among all foods eaten.[100][101][102] 1986 California Proposition 65 requires a warning label on chocolate products having more than 4.1 mg of cadmium per daily serving of a single product.[103][104][105]\n\nCaffeine\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[106] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[107] Although a single 7 oz. (200 ml) serving of coffee may contain 80–175 mg,[108] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg, and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[109]\n\nTheobromine and oxalate\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[110] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50–100 g cocoa (0.8–1.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling, and severe headache.[111]\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[112][113] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[114]\n\nNon-human animals\nMain article: Theobromine poisoning\nIn sufficient amounts, the theobromine found in chocolate is toxic to animals such as cats, dogs, horses, parrots, and small rodents because they are unable to metabolise the chemical effectively.[115] If animals are fed chocolate, the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20 hours, possibly causing epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. Medical treatment performed by a veterinarian involves inducing vomiting within two hours of ingestion and administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates for seizures, antiarrhythmics for heart arrhythmias, and fluid diuresis.\nA typical 20-kilogram (44 lb) dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than 240 grams (8.5 oz) of dark chocolate, but will not necessarily experience bradycardia or tachycardia unless it eats at least a half a kilogram (1.1 lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, approximately 1.3 grams of baker\'s chocolate per kilogram of a dog\'s body weight (0.02 oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical 25-gram (0.88 oz) baker\'s chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a 20-kilogram (44 lb) dog.  In the 20th century, there were reports that mulch made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.[116][117]\n\nResearch\nObesity\nCommonly consumed chocolate is high in fat and sugar, which are associated with an increased risk for obesity when chocolate is consumed in excess.[118]\n\nAcne\nOverall evidence is insufficient to determine the relationship between chocolate consumption and acne.[119][120] Various studies point not to chocolate, but to the high glycemic nature of certain foods, like sugar, corn syrup, and other simple carbohydrates, as potential causes of acne,[119][120][121][122] along with other possible dietary factors.[119][123]\n\nAddiction\nMain article: Chocoholic\nFood, including chocolate, is not typically viewed as addictive.[124] Some people, however, may want or crave chocolate,[124] leading to a self-described term, chocoholic.[124][125]\n\nMood\nBy some popular myths, chocolate is considered to be a mood enhancer, such as by increasing sex drive or stimulating cognition, but there is little scientific evidence that such effects are consistent among all chocolate consumers.[126][127] If mood improvement from eating chocolate occurs, there is not enough research to indicate whether it results from the favorable flavor or from the stimulant effects of its constituents, such as caffeine, theobromine, or their parent molecule, methylxanthine.[127] A 2019 review reported that chocolate consumption does not improve depressive mood.[128]\n\nHeart and blood vessels\nReviews support a short-term effect of lowering blood pressure by consuming cocoa products, but there is no evidence of long-term cardiovascular health benefit.[129][130]  Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[131] or enhances cognitive abilities.[132]\nWhile daily consumption of cocoa flavanols (minimum dose of 200 mg) appears to benefit platelet and vascular function,[133] there is no good evidence to indicate an effect on heart attacks or strokes.[133][134] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[135]\n\nLabeling\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of \"cocoa\" or \"cacao\". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[136] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[137][138] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[139] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as \"vegelate\".[139]\nChocolates that are organic[140] or fair trade certified[141] carry labels accordingly.\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as \"chocolate\". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated \"Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.\"[142]\n\nIndustry\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[143] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[144] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[145] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[146] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are often unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast makes them inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what chocolate tastes like.[147]\n\nManufacturers\nMain article: List of bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturers\nChocolate with various fillings\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Sprüngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[148] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\nFood conglomerates Nestlé SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestlé acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[149] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\nMain article: Children in cocoa production\nSee also: Cocoa production in Ivory Coast\nSee also: Cocoa production in Ghana\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in the Ivory Coast, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[150] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[151] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa,[152] and the Ivory Coast in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa.[152] Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[153] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestlé, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[154]\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[155] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in \"harsh and abusive\"[156] conditions for the production of chocolate,[155] and an increasing number of health-food[157] and anti-slavery[158] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and Côte d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[4] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: \"I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.\"[151] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program – conducted by Nestlé with 26,000 farmers mostly located in Côte d\'Ivoire – observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[3] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and Côte d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[159] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and Côte d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[3][4] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[160] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[3][161]\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: \"Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020\".[161]\n\nFair trade\nMain article: Fair trade\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[162] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[163] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[164]\n\nUsage and consumption\nBars\nMain article: Chocolate bar\nA chocolate bar\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caffè mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nPopular culture\nReligious and cultural links\nA gift box of chocolates, which is a common gift for Valentine\'s Day\nChocolate is associated with festivals such as Easter, when moulded chocolate rabbits and eggs are traditionally given in Christian communities, and Hanukkah, when chocolate coins are given in Jewish communities. Chocolate hearts and chocolate in heart-shaped boxes are popular on Valentine\'s Day and are often presented along with flowers and a greeting card. In 1868, Cadbury created a decorated box of chocolates in the shape of a heart for Valentine\'s Day.[42][165] Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday.[42] Chocolate is an acceptable gift on other holidays and on occasions such as birthdays.\nMany confectioners make holiday-specific chocolate candies. Chocolate Easter eggs or rabbits and Santa Claus figures are two examples. Such confections can be solid, hollow, or filled with sweets or fondant.\n\nBooks and film\nChocolate has been the center of several successful book and film adaptations.\nIn 1964, Roald Dahl published a children\'s novel titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The novel centers on a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who takes a tour through the greatest chocolate factory in the world, owned by the eccentric Willy Wonka.[166] Two film adaptations of the novel were produced: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). A third adaptation, an origin prequel film titled Wonka, is scheduled for release in 2023.[167]\nLike Water for Chocolate a 1989 love story by novelist Laura Esquivel, was adapted to film in 1992. Chocolat, a 1999 novel by Joanne Harris, was adapted for film in Chocolat which was released a year later.[168]\n\nSee also\n\nFood portalNutrition portalMesoamerica portal\nMain article: Outline of chocolate\n\nCandida krusei\nCandy making\nChildren in cocoa production\nChocolataire\nChocolate almonds\nChocolate chip\nChocoholic\nCuestión moral: si el chocolate quebranta el ayuno eclesiástico\nList of chocolate-covered foods\nList of chocolate beverages\nList of chocolate companies\nTheobroma cacao, the cocoa/chocolate plant\nUnited States military chocolate\nTypes of chocolate\nReferences\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Zarrillo S, Gaikwad N, Lanaud C, Powis T, Viot C, Lesur I, et al.

Most sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century cacao was for drinking, but its consumption in solid form was not unheard of. To make a drink out of processed cacao beans they must be ground, and then, unless they are immediately made into a drink, the mass congeals. [...] A tablet of this nature could be dissolved in hot water to make the breakfast chocolate, but it could also be nibbled. [...] With the addition of sugar this began the production of what are called modern chocolates. Many people take it to mean that solid chocolate was not eaten before Van Houten\'s time, but as the preceding paragraph has shown, this is not so.\n\n^ Davidson, Alan (2014).

Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet\'s largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet\'s internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]\nThe company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant & Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]\nGoogle\'s other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).[17]\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, online video platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share.[18] On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[19] and fourth by Interbrand.[20] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.\n\n\nHistory\nMain articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\nSee also: Alphabet Inc.\nEarly years\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[21][22][23] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[24][25] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[26][27]\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[28] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website\'s relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[29][30] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page\'s ideas.[24]\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[21][31][32] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[33] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page\'s PageRank patent including a citation to Li\'s earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[34][35]\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol,[21][36][37] a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[38]\n\nGoogle\'s original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages[39]\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[21] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.[40][41] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David\'s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.[42][43]\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[44] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google\'s founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google\'s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos\' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[45][46]\nBetween these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[47]\nCraig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[23][48][49]\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[44] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[50] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[41] Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google\'s great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.[51]\n\nGrowth\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[52] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[53] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin\'s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[54][23] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[55] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[56][57]\n\nGoogle\'s first production server[58]\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[59] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[60] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".[61][62] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[63]\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google\'s investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[47] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia\'s $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company\'s full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[64]\n\nInitial public offering\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page, Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[65] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[66][67] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[68][69] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[70]\n\nEric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011\nOn November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[71][72][73][74] On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion for the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC.[75] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[76][77] By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.[47]\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[78][79] In May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.[80][81][82] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola\'s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[83] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[84] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[85]\n\n2012 onwards\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million.[86] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google\'s own mapping service.[87] Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[88]\n\nEntrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[89] Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.[90][91] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google\'s recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[92] In 2015, DeepMind\'s AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\nAccording to Interbrand\'s annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[93] 2014,[94] 2015,[95] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[96]\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet\'s largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet\'s Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[97][98][99]\n\nCurrent CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google\'s Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[100] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.[101][102][103]\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company\'s leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.[104][105] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the \'Father of Android\'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[106] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company\'s handling of sexual harassment complaints.[107][108] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.[109] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.[105]\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[110]\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations.[111] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[112]\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google\'s new commerce chief. Ready\'s role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[113]\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.[114] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [115]\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[116][117][118]\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[119]\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.[120]\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[121] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.[122]\nIn April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.[123]\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google\'s capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.[124]\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.[125]\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google\'s Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.[126][127]\nIn early 2023, following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google\'s senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[128]\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company\'s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google\'s total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[129]\n\nProducts and services\nMain article: List of Google products\nSearch engine\nMain articles: Google Search and Google Images\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[130] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[131] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts\' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[132][133]\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[134] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[135]\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[136] finance (launched 2006),[137] and flights (launched 2011).[138]\n\nAdvertising\nGoogle at ad-tech London, 2010\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[139] In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[140][141] In 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[142]\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[143] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[144] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[145] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[146] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website\'s visibility.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nGoogle had previously utilized virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the announcement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate competitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini.[147]  An artificial intelligence training program for Google employees was also introduced in April 2024.[148]\n\nConsumer services\nWeb-based services\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[149] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[150] Google Maps for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[151] Google Drive for cloud storage of files,[152] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[152] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing,[153] Google Keep for note-taking,[154] Google Translate for language translation,[155] YouTube for video viewing and sharing,[156] Google My Business for managing public business information,[157] and Duo for social interaction.[158] In March 2019, Google unveiled a cloud gaming service named Stadia.[110] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[159][160][161] Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites.[162] Some Google services are not web-based. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allows users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[163]\n\nSoftware\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[164] as well as its smartwatch,[165] television,[166] car,[167] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[168] It also develops the Google Chrome web browser,[169] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[170]\n\nHardware\nGoogle Pixel smartphones on display in a store\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[171] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[172] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[173]\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.[174]\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[175][176]\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[177]\nOther hardware products include:\n\nNest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home[178] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\nNest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[179]\nEnterprise services\nMain articles: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform\nGoogle Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020[180]) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google\'s services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.[181]\nOn September 24, 2012,[182] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships.[183] Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\".[184] Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[185]\n\nInternet services\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[186][187] Following Google\'s corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet\'s Access division.[188][189]\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.[190][191]\n\nFinancial services\nIn August 2023, Google became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.[192]\n\nCorporate affairs\nStock price performance and quarterly earnings\nGoogle\'s initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[66][67] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[70] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[193] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[194] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[194] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[195] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google\'s holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][196]\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[197][198][199]\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[200] In 2011, 96% of Google\'s revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[201]\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[202]\nGoogle\'s consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[203] Google\'s Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users\' clicks on advertisements.[204] By January 2014, Google\'s market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[205]\n\nTax avoidance strategies\nFurther information: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Google tax\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[206] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google\'s transfer pricing practices in 2012.[207]\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.[208]\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[209] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[210] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[211]\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[212]\n\nCorporate identity\nFurther information: History of Google § Name, Google (verb), Google logo, Google Doodle, List of Google April Fools\' Day jokes, and List of Google Easter eggs\nGoogle\'s logo from 2013 to 2015\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[213][214] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[33] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"[215][216] Google\'s mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful\",[217] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don\'t be evil\".[218] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\".[219] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[220] Since 1998,[update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[221][222] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[223]\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools\' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[224] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[225]\nGoogle\'s services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef\'s \"Bork bork bork,\" Pig Latin, \"Hacker\" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[226] When searching for the word \"anagram,\" meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google\'s suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[227] Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[228]\n\nWorkplace culture\nGoogle employees marching in the Pride in London parade in 2016\nOn Fortune magazine\'s list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[229][230][231] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[232][233] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world\'s most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.[234] Google\'s corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil,\" \"you can be serious without a suit,\" and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.\"[235]\nAs of September 30, 2020,[update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,[236] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.[8] Google\'s 2020[update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).[237] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[238] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019.[update][8]\nGoogle\'s employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six.\"[239] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google\'s services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense, originated from these independent endeavors.[240] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google\'s vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[241]\nIn 2005, articles in The New York Times[242] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[243][244][245] In an effort to maintain the company\'s unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[246] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[247][248] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[249] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[250]\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.[251] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland.\"[252] The group is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[252][253][250] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[254] In 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[255]\n\nOffice locations \nFurther information: Googleplex\nGoogle\'s New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team.\nGoogle\'s Toronto office\nGoogle\'s headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[256]\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team.[257] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[258][259] In March 2018, Google\'s parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[260][261][262][263] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[264] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan\'s Hudson Square neighborhood.[265][266] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[267]\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[268] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon\'s campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[269][270] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,[271] and Madison, Wisconsin.[272]\n\nGoogle\'s Dublin Ireland office, headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[273] and London (part of Android development).[274] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal\'s announcement in January,[275] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[276][277] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company\'s largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[278][279]\nGoogle\'s Global Offices sum a total of 85 Locations worldwide,[280] with 32 offices in North America, 3 of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google\'s offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK), the Asia Pacific region counts with 18 offices principally 4 in India and 3 in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts 5 offices.\n\nNorth America\n\n\nSN\nCity\nCountry or US State\n\n\n1.\nAnn Arbor\n Michigan\n\n\n2.\nAtlanta\n Georgia\n\n\n3.\nAustin\n Texas\n\n\n4.\nBoulder\n Colorado\n\n\n5.\nBoulder – Pearl Place\n Colorado\n\n\n6.\nBoulder – Walnut\n Colorado\n\n\n7.\nCambridge\n Massachusetts\n\n\n8.\nChapel Hill\n North Carolina\n\n\n9.\nChicago – Carpenter\n Illinois\n\n\n10.\nChicago – Fulton Market\n Illinois\n\n\n11.\nDetroit\n Michigan\n\n\n12.\nIrvine\n California\n\n\n13.\nKirkland\n Washington\n\n\n14.\nKitchener\n Canada\n\n\n15.\nLos Angeles\n California\n\n\n16.\nMadison\n Wisconsin\n\n\n17.\nMiami\n Florida\n\n\n18.\nMontreal\n Canada\n\n\n19.\nMountain View\n California\n\n\n20.\nNew York\n New York\n\n\n21.\nPittsburgh\n Pennsylvania\n\n\n22.\nPlaya Vista\n California\n\n\n23.\nPortland\n Oregon\n\n\n24.\nRedwood City\n California\n\n\n25.\nReston\n Virginia\n\n\n26.\nSan Bruno\n California\n\n\n27.\nSan Diego\n California\n\n\n28.\nSan Francisco – HQ\n California\n\n\n29.\nSeattle\n Washington\n\n\n30.\nSunnyvale\n California\n\n\n31.\nToronto\n Canada\n\n\n32.\nWashington DC\n District of Columbia\n\nLatin America\n\n\nSN\nCity\nCountry\n\n\n1.\nBelo Horizonte\n Brazil\n\n\n2.\nBogotá\n Colombia\n\n\n3.\nBuenos Aires\n Argentina\n\n\n4.\nMexico City\n Mexico\n\n\n5.\nSantiago\n Chile\n\n\n6.\nSão Paulo\n Brazil\n\nEurope\n\n\nSN\nCity\nCountry\n\n\n1.\nAarhus\n Denmark\n\n\n2.\nAmsterdam\n Netherlands\n\n\n3.\nAthens\n Greece\n\n\n4.\nBerlin\n Germany\n\n\n5.\nBrussels\n Belgium\n\n\n6.\nCopenhagen\n Denmark\n\n\n7.\nDublin\n Ireland\n\n\n8.\nHamburg\n Germany\n\n\n9.\nLisbon\n Portugal\n\n\n10.\nLondon – 6PS\n United Kingdom\n\n\n11.\nLondon – BEL\n United Kingdom\n\n\n12.\nLondon – CSG\n United Kingdom\n\n\n13.\nMadrid\n Spain\n\n\n14.\nMilan\n Italy\n\n\n15.\nMoscow\n Russia\n\n\n16.\nMunich\n Germany\n\n\n17.\nOslo\n Norway\n\n\n18.\nParis\n France\n\n\n19.\nPrague\n Czech Republic\n\n\n20.\nStockholm\n Sweden\n\n\n21.\nVienna\n Austria\n\n\n22.\nWarsaw\n Poland\n\n\n23.\nWrocław\n Poland\n\n\n24.\nZürich – BRA\n Switzerland\n\n\n25.\nZürich – EUR\n Switzerland\n\nAsia–Pacific\n\n\nSN\nCity\nCountry\n\n\n1.\nAuckland\n New Zealand\n\n\n2.\nBangalore\n India\n\n\n3.\nBangkok\n Thailand\n\n\n4.\nBeijing\n China\n\n\n5.\nGuangzhou\n China\n\n\n6.\nGurgaon\n India\n\n\n7.\nHong Kong\n Hong Kong\n\n\n8.\nHyderabad\n India\n\n\n9.\nJakarta\n Indonesia\n\n\n10.\nKuala Lumpur\n Malaysia\n\n\n11.\nManila\n Philippines\n\n\n12.\nMelbourne\n Australia\n\n\n13.\nMumbai\n India\n\n\n14.\nSeoul\n South Korea\n\n\n15.\nShanghai\n China\n\n\n16.\nSingapore\n Singapore\n\n\n17.\nSydney\n Australia\n\n\n18.\nTaipei\n Taiwan\n\n\n19.\nTokyo – RPG\n Japan\n\n\n20.\nTokyo – STRM\n Japan\n\nAfrica and the Middle East\n\n\nSN\nCity\nCountry\n\n\n1.\nDubai\n United Arab Emirates\n\n\n2.\nHaifa\n Israel\n\n\n3.\nIstanbul\n Turkey\n\n\n4.\nJohannesburg\n South Africa\n\n\n5.\nTel Aviv\n Israel\n\nInfrastructure\nFurther information: Google data centers\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[281] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[282] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[283][284][285] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[285]\nGoogle has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[286][287] The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.[288] Google\'s third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal with Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa.[289] The company\'s fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York, US, Bude, UK and Bilbao, Spain, and is expected to become operational in 2022.[290]\n\nEnvironment\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus\' energy needs.[291][292] The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[291] Since 2007,[update] Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[293]\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[294]\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[295] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[296] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[297]\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[298]\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world\'s largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[299][300][301]\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[302] In September 2019, Google\'s chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[303]\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company\'s foundation in 1998.[304] It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[305] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.[306]\n\nClimate change denial and misinformation\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.[307][308] The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[309] Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[310]\n\nPhilanthropy\nMain article: Google.org\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[311] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program\'s executive director in 2004[312] and Megan Smith has since[update] replaced him as director.[313]\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[314] In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[315][316] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\" campaign in support of gay rights.[317]\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[318] After two years of no update, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[319] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[320]\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[321] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[322]\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.[323]\n\nCriticism and controversies\nFurther information: Criticism of Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding GoogleThis section should include a better summary of Criticism of Google. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article\'s main text. (April 2019)\nSan Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance,[324] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content,[325] and privacy.[326][327]\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people\'s intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people\'s privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.\nGoogle formerly complied with Internet censorship policies of the People\'s Republic of China,[328] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as \"The Great Firewall of China\", but no longer does so. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of virtual private networks, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.\n\n2018\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[329][330]\nIn August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing for the People\'s Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[331][332] However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.[333][334]\n\n2019\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[335] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\nIn April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[336]\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals\' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[337] According to The Wall Street Journal, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[338]\n\n2022\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—Project Vivian—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.[339]\nGoogle reportedly paid Apple a staggering $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on Safari. This deal underscores the intense competition in the tech industry for dominance in the search market. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.[340]\n\n2023\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country\'s government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.[341][342]\n\n2024\nIn March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese corporations.[343] Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years, having been hired in 2019.[344] Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned companies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation.[345]\n\nRacially-targeted surveillance\nGoogle has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the FBI information collected from all Android users at a Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle,[346] including those who had opted out of location data collection.[347][348]\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel\'s borders under strict security guidelines.\"[349][350][351] The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of Palestinians\' human rights in the context of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[352][353] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google\'s educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google\'s complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear\",  and said she was retaliated against for organizing against the project.[349][354]\nIn March 2024, The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition program by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amid the Israel-Hamas War. A Google spokesman commented that the service is free and \"does not provide identities for unknown people in photographs.\"[355]\nOn April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company\'s involvement in Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government to provide cloud computing and AI infrastructure, which the employees argued should not be used for military or intelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at Google\'s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California,[356] leading to disruptions and blockages within the company facilities.[357][358] This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of Palestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.[359][360]\n\nAnti-trust, privacy, and other litigation\nMain article: Google litigation\nThe European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019\nFines and lawsuits\nEuropean Union\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"[361]\nOn July 18, 2018,[362] the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google\'s constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[363] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[364]\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[365][366][367]\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google\'s rivals.[368][369]\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google\'s search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its policy.[370]\n\nFrance\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union\'s General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.[371]\nOn January 6, 2022, France\'s data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet\'s Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.[372]\nOn March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content from news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini, violating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.[373]\n\nUnited States\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[374] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives\' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October,[375] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[376][377] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.[378] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[379][380] Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.[381]\n\nPrivate browsing lawsuit\nSee also: Private browsing\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome\'s Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[382][383] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google\'s request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group\'s charges.[384][385] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google\'s CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[386]\nIn April 2024, it was announced that Google agreed to settle this lawsuit.  Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately.[387]\n\nGender discrimination lawsuit\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California\'s Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.[388][389][390]\n\nU.S. government contracts\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA\'s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[391] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[392]\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[393] In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[394] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.[395]\n\nSee also\nPortals: Companies Telecommunication Electronics Technology\n\nOutline of Google\nHistory of Google\nCriticism of Google\nList of Google products\nGoogle China\nGoogle logo\nGooglization\nGoogle.org\nGoogle ATAP\nList of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\nSurveillance Capitalism\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Fitzpatrick, Alex (September 4, 2014). \"Google Used to Be the Company That Did \'Nothing But Search\'\".

It was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the world\'s dominant computing platform, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.[12]\nIBM entered the microcomputer market in the 1980s with the IBM Personal Computer, which soon became known as PC, one of IBM\'s best selling products. Due to a lack of foresight by IBM,[13][14] the PC was not well protected by intellectual property laws. As a consequence, IBM quickly began losing its market dominance to emerging competitors in the PC market, while at the same time the openness of the PC platform has ensured PC\'s longevity as the most popular microcomputer standard. \nBeginning in the 1990s, the company began downsizing its operations and divesting from commodity production, most notably selling its personal computer division to the Lenovo Group in 2005. IBM has since concentrated on computer services, software, supercomputers, and scientific research. Since 2000, its supercomputers have consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world, and in 2001 it became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year, beating this record in 2008 with over 4,000 patents.[12] As of 2022, the company held 150,000 patents.[15]\nAs one of the world\'s oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations, including the automated teller machine (ATM), dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, and the UPC barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure.[16][17][18] IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six Nobel Prizes and six Turing Awards.[19]\nIBM is a publicly traded company and one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It is among the world\'s largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022.[20] Despite its relative decline within the technology sector,[21] IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue, and 67th largest overall company by revenue in the United States. It is also consistently ranked among the world\'s most recognizable, valuable, and admired brands.[22]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of IBM\nIBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century. Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[23] Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[24] Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine (1889);[25] and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record workers\' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889).[26] On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[1][27] The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Canada.[citation needed]\nCollectively, the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.[28] Watson joined CTR as general manager and then, 11 months later, was made President when antitrust cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[29] Having learned Patterson\'s pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR\'s companies.[30] He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\".[31][32] His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company\'s employees.[31] During Watson\'s first four years, revenues reached $9 million ($158 million today) and the company\'s operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[31] Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\" which had previously been used as the name of CTR\'s Canadian Division;[33] the name was changed on February 14, 1924.[34] By 1933, most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[35]\n\nNACA researchers using an IBM type 704 electronic data processing machine in 1957\nThe Nazis made extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM\'s majority-owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (Dehomag), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. This census data was used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the Holocaust, including internment in the concentration camps.[36] Nazi concentration camps operated a Hollerith department called Hollerith Abteilung, which had IBM machines, including calculating and sorting machines.[37]\nIBM produced 6% of the M1 Carbine rifles used in World War II, about 346,500 of them, between August 1943 and May. IBM never produced guns for civilian sales, only for the military.\nIBM built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the vacuum tube based IBM 701, in 1952. The IBM 305 RAMAC introduced the hard disk drive in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the 7000 and 1400 series, beginning in 1958.\nIn 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM\'s Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter.\nIn 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission. IBM also developed and manufactured the Saturn V\'s Instrument Unit and Apollo spacecraft guidance computers.\n\nAn IBM System/360 in use at the University of Michigan c. 1969\nIBM guidance computer hardware for the Saturn V Instrument Unit\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.[38]\nIn 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM\'s actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982, the Department of Justice dropped the case as \"without merit\".[39]\nAlso in 1969, IBM engineer Forrest Parry invented the magnetic stripe card that would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver\'s licenses, rapid transit cards, and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers. In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code.[40] IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981, when they entered into a swap agreement.[41] The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard.\nIn 1991 IBM began spinning off its many divisions into autonomous subsidiaries (so-called \"Baby Blues\") in an attempt to make the company more manageable and to streamline IBM by having other investors finance those companies.[42][43] These included AdStar, dedicated to disk drives and other data storage products; IBM Application Business Systems, dedicated to mid-range computers; IBM Enterprise Systems, dedicated to mainframes; Pennant Systems, dedicated to mid-range and large printers; Lexmark, dedicated to small printers; and more.[44] Lexmark was acquired by Clayton & Dubilier in a leveraged buyout shortly after its formation.[45]\nIn September 1992, IBM completed the spin-off of their various non-mainframe and non-midrange, personal computer manufacturing divisions, combining them into an autonomous wholly owned subsidiary known as the IBM Personal Computer Company (IBM PC Co.).[46][47] This corporate restructuring came after IBM reported a sharp drop in profit margins during the second quarter of fiscal year 1992; market analysts attributed the drop to a fierce price war in the personal computer market over the summer of 1992.[48] The corporate restructuring was one of the largest and most expensive in history up to that point.[49] By the summer of 1993, the IBM PC Co. had divided into multiple business units itself, including Ambra Computer Corporation and the IBM Power Personal Systems Group, the former an attempt to design and market \"clone\" computers of IBM\'s own architecture and the latter responsible for IBM\'s PowerPC-based workstations.[50][51]\nIn 1993, IBM posted an $8 billion loss – at the time the biggest in American corporate history.[52] Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around.[53] In 2002 IBM acquired PwC Consulting, the consulting arm of PwC which was merged into its IBM Global Services.[54][55]\n\nIBM inventions (clockwise from top-left): the hard-disk drive, DRAM, the UPC bar code, and the magnetic stripe card\nIn 1998, IBM merged the enterprise-oriented Personal Systems Group of the IBM PC Co. into IBM\'s own Global Services personal computer consulting and customer service division. The resulting merged business units then became known simply as IBM Personal Systems Group.[56] In 1999, IBM stopped selling their computers at retail outlets after their market share in this sector had fallen considerably behind competitors Compaq and Dell.[57] Immediately afterwards, the IBM PC Co. was dissolved and merged into IBM Personal Systems Group.[58]\nOn September 14, 2004, LG and IBM announced that their business alliance in the South Korean market would end at the end of that year. Both companies stated that it was unrelated to the charges of bribery earlier that year.[59][60][61][62] Xnote was originally part of the joint venture and was sold by LG in 2012.[63]\nIn 2005, the company sold all of its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo[64] and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM\'s Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16. In 2012, IBM announced it had agreed to buy Kenexa and Texas Memory Systems,[65] and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.[66] Also that year, the company designed a video surveillance system for Davao City.[67]\nIn 2014 IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for $2.1 billion.[68] while continuing to offer Power ISA-based servers. Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc.,[69][70] Twitter,[71] Facebook,[72] Tencent,[73] Cisco,[74] UnderArmour,[75] Box,[76] Microsoft,[77] VMware,[78] CSC,[79] Macy\'s,[80] Sesame Workshop,[81] the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.[82]\nIn 2015, IBM announced three major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion,[83] data storage vendor Cleversafe, and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app.[84][85] Also that year, IBM employees created the film A Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit.[86][87] In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.[88] The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[89]\nIn 2015, IBM bought the digital part of The Weather Company,[90] Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion in 2016, and in October 2018, IBM announced its intention to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion,[91][92][93] which was completed on July 9, 2019.[94]\nIn February of 2020, IBM\'s John Kelly III joined Brad Smith of Microsoft to sign a pledge with the Vatican to ensure the ethical use and practice of Artificial Intelligence (AI).[95]\nIBM announced in October 2020 that it would divest the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services division into a new public company.[96] The new company, Kyndryl, will have 90,000 employees, 4,600 clients in 115 countries, with a backlog of $60 billion.[97][98][99] IBM\'s spin off was greater than any of its previous divestitures, and welcomed by investors.[100][101][102] IBM appointed Martin Schroeter, who had been IBM\'s CFO from 2014 through the end of 2017, as CEO of Kyndryl.[103][104]\nOn March 7, 2022, a few days after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna published a Ukrainian flag and announced that \"we have suspended all business in Russia\". All Russian articles were also removed from the IBM website.[105] On June 7, Krishna announced that IBM would carry out an \"orderly wind-down\" of its operations in Russia.[106]\nIn 2023, IBM acquired Manta Software Inc. to complement its data and AI governance capabilities for an undisclosed amount.[107] On November 16, 2023, IBM suspended ads on Twitter after Elon Musk\'s antisemitic comments.[108][109]\nIn December 2023, IBM announced it would acquire Software AG\'s StreamSets and webMethods platforms for €2.13 billion ($2.33 billion).[110]\n\nCorporate affairs[edit]\nBusiness trends[edit]\nIBM\'s market capitalization was valued at over $127 billion as of April 2021.[111] IBM ranked No. 38 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[112] In 2014, IBM was accused of using \"financial engineering\" to hit its quarterly earnings targets rather than investing for the longer term.[113][114][115]\nThe key trends of IBM are (as at the financial year ending December 31):[116][117]\n\n\n\nYear\n\nRevenue(US$ bn)\n\nNet income(US$ bn)\n\nEmployees\n\n\n2014\n\n92.7\n\n12.0\n\n379,592\n\n\n2015\n\n81.7\n\n13.1\n\n377,757\n\n\n2016\n\n79.9\n\n11.8\n\n380,300\n\n\n2017\n\n79.1\n\n5.7\n\n366,600\n\n\n2018\n\n79.5\n\n8.7\n\n350,600\n\n\n2019\n\n77.1\n\n9.4\n\n352,600\n\n\n2020\n\n73.6\n\n5.5\n\n345,900\n\n\n2021[a]\n\n57.3\n\n5.7\n\n282,100\n\n\n2022\n\n60.5\n\n1.6\n\n288,300\n\n\n2023\n\n61.8\n\n7.5\n\n282,200\n\nHeadquarters and offices[edit]\nIBM CHQ in Armonk, New York in 2014\nPangu Plaza, one of IBM\'s offices in Beijing, China\nIBM is headquartered in Armonk, New York, a community 37 miles (60 km) north of Midtown Manhattan.[118] A nickname for the company is the \"Colossus of Armonk\".[119] Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a 283,000-square-foot (26,300 m2) glass and stone edifice on a 25-acre (10 ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s.[120] There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM\'s headquarters; and the Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., Center for Learning[121] (formerly known as IBM Learning Center (ILC)), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.[122]\nIBM operates in 174 countries as of 2016[update],[2] with mobility centers in smaller market areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City, IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including the IBM Watson headquarters at Astor Place in Manhattan. Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States include Austin, Texas; Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina; Rochester, Minnesota; and Silicon Valley, California.\nIBM\'s real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include 1250 René-Lévesque (Montreal, Canada) and One Atlantic Center (Atlanta, Georgia, US). In Beijing, China, IBM occupies Pangu Plaza,[123] the city\'s seventh tallest building and overlooking Beijing National Stadium (\"Bird\'s Nest\"), home to the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nIBM India Private Limited is the Indian subsidiary of IBM, which is headquartered at Bangalore, Karnataka. It has facilities in Coimbatore, Chennai, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, Bhubaneshwar, Surat, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Jamshedpur.\nOther notable buildings include the IBM Rome Software Lab (Rome, Italy), Hursley House (Winchester, UK), 330 North Wabash (Chicago, Illinois, United States), the Cambridge Scientific Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States), the IBM Toronto Software Lab (Toronto, Canada), the IBM Building, Johannesburg (Johannesburg, South Africa), the IBM Building (Seattle) (Seattle, Washington, United States), the IBM Hakozaki Facility (Tokyo, Japan), the IBM Yamato Facility (Yamato, Japan), the IBM Canada Head Office Building (Ontario, Canada) and the Watson IoT Headquarters[124] (Munich, Germany). Defunct IBM campuses include the IBM Somers Office Complex (Somers, New York), Spango Valley (Greenock, Scotland), and Tour Descartes (Paris, France). The company\'s contributions to industrial architecture and design include works by Marcel Breuer, Eero Saarinen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, I.M. Pei and Ricardo Legorreta. Van der Rohe\'s building in Chicago was recognized with the 1990 Honor Award from the National Building Museum.[125]\nIBM was recognized as one of the Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2005, which recognized Fortune 500 companies that provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution.[126] In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM\'s contribution in its early days to pollution in its original location in Endicott, New York.[127][128]\n\nProducts and services[edit]\nSee also: List of IBM products\nBlue Gene was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2009.\nIBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016[update], these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, commerce, data and analytics, Internet of things (IoT),[129] IT infrastructure, mobile, digital workplace[130] and cybersecurity.[131]\nIBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers.[132] IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.[133]\nHardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM\'s Power microprocessors, which were designed into many console gaming systems, including Xbox 360,[134] PlayStation 3, and Nintendo\'s Wii U.[135][136] IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors,[137] and in 2014, the company revealed TrueNorth, a neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit and announced a $3 billion investment over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.[138] In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.[139]\nIT outsourcing also represents a major service provided by IBM, with more than 60 data centers worldwide.[140] IBM Developer is IBM\'s source for emerging software technologies, and SPSS is a software package used for statistical analysis. IBM\'s Kenexa suite provides employment and retention solutions[buzzword], and includes the BrassRing, an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies for recruiting.[141] IBM also owns The Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includes weather.com and Weather Underground.[142]\nSmarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress,[143][144] targeting opportunities such as smart grids,[145] water management systems,[146] solutions to traffic congestion,[147] and greener buildings.[148]\nServices provisions include Redbooks, which are publicly available online books about best practices with IBM products, and developerWorks, a website for software developers and IT professionals with how-to articles and tutorials, as well as software downloads, code samples, discussion forums, podcasts, blogs, wikis, and other resources for developers and technical professionals.[149]\nIBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data.[150] Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game show Jeopardy!, where it competed against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings.[151] Several companies use Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents.[152]\n\nIBM Q System One (2019), the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer\nIn January 2019, IBM introduced its first commercial quantum computer: IBM Q System One.[153]\nIBM also provides infrastructure for the New York City Police Department through their IBM Cognos Analytics to perform data visualizations of CompStat crime data.[154]\nIn March 2020, it was announced that IBM will build the first quantum computer in Germany. The computer should allow researchers to harness the technology without falling foul of the EU\'s increasingly assertive stance on data sovereignty.[155]\nIn June 2020, IBM announced that it was exiting the facial recognition business. In a letter to congress,[156] IBM\'s Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told lawmakers, \"now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.\"[157]\nIn May 2022, IBM announced the company had signed a multi-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Amazon Web Services to make a wide variety of IBM software available as a service on AWS Marketplace. Additionally, the deal includes both companies making joint investments that make it easier for companies to consume IBM\'s offering and integrate them with AWS, including developer training and software development for select markets.[158]\nIn November 2022, the company came out with a chip called the 433-qubit Osprey. Time called it \"the world\'s most powerful quantum processor\" and noted that if the processor\'s speed were represented in bits, the number would be larger than the total number of atoms in the universe.[159]\nIn an effort to streamline its products and services, beginning in the 1990s, IBM has regularly sold off low margin assets while shifting its focus to higher-value, more profitable markets. In 1991, the company spun off its printer and keyboard manufacturing division to Lexmark, in 2005 it sold its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) business to Lenovo, in 2015 it adopted a \"fabless\" model with semiconductors design and offloaded manufacturing to GlobalFoundries, and in 2021 it spun-off its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company named Kyndryl.[160][161] IBM also announced the acquisition of the enterprise software company Turbonomic for $1.5 billion.[162] In 2022, IBM announced it would sell Watson Health to private equity firm Francisco Partners.[163] IBM also started a collaboration with new Japanese manufacturer Rapidus in late 2022,[164] which led GlobalFoundries to file a lawsuit against IBM the following year.[165]\n\nResearch[edit]\nThe Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, is one of 12 IBM research labs worldwide.\nIBM Fellow Benoit Mandelbrot discusses fractal geometry, 2010.\nResearch has been part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan\'s West Side into IBM\'s first laboratory. Now, IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.[166] IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, Tokyo lab, Zurichlab and Africa lab in Nairobi.\nIn terms of investment, IBM\'s R&D expenditure totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9 billion.[167] Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for Watson in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company\'s \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.[168]\nIBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began supporting Linux in 1998.[169] The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center, which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers.[170] IBM has also released code under different open-source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately $40 million at the time of the donation),[171] the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM\'s open source involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see SCO v. IBM).\nFamous inventions and developments by IBM include: the automated teller machine (ATM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time.[172] A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world\'s most prolific patent sources. In 2021, the company held the record for most patents generated by a business for 29 consecutive years for the achievement.[9]\nFive IBM employees have received the Nobel Prize: Leo Esaki, of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the scanning tunneling microscope;[173] and Georg Bednorz and Alex Müller, also of Zurich, in 1987, for research in superconductivity. Six IBM employees have won the Turing Award, including the first female recipient Frances E. Allen.[174] Ten National Medals of Technology (USA) and five National Medals of Science (USA) have been awarded to IBM employees.\n\nBrand and reputation[edit]\nIBM ads at John F. Kennedy International Airport, 2013\nIBM is nicknamed Big Blue partly due to its blue logo and color scheme,[175][176] and also in reference to its former de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[175][177] The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current \"8-bar\" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand.[178] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex.\nIBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[179] As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master\'s governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club.[180] IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open.[181] The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960 to 2000,[182] and the National Football League from 2003 to 2012.[183]\nIn 2012, IBM\'s brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by Interbrand as the third-best brand worldwide.[184] That same year, it was also ranked the top company for leaders (Fortune), the number two green company in the U.S. (Newsweek),[185] the second-most respected company (Barron\'s),[186] the fifth-most admired company (Fortune), the 18th-most innovative company (Fast Company), and the number one in technology consulting and number two in outsourcing (Vault).[187] In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM as the fifth-most valuable brand,[188] and for 2020, the Drucker Institute named IBM the No. 3 best-managed company.[189] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, IBM donated $250,000 to Polish Humanitarian Action and the same amount to People in Need, Czech Republic.[190]\nIn terms of ESG, IBM reported its total CO2e emissions (direct and indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 621 kilotons (-324 /-34.3% year-on-year).[191] In February 2021, IBM committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030.[192]\n\nPeople and culture[edit]\nEmployees[edit]\nSee also: IBM and unions and List of IBM CEOs\nNew IBM employees being welcomed to a bootcamp at IBM Austin, 2015\nEmployees demonstrating IBM Watson capabilities in a Jeopardy! exhibition match on campus, 2011\nIBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as \"IBMers\". The company pioneered in several employment practices unheard of at the time.  IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO Thomas J. Watson, Jr. published the company\'s first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Human Rights Campaign has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,[193] with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to formally commit to not using genetic information in employment decisions. In 2017, IBM was named to Working Mother\'s 100 Best Companies List for the 32nd consecutive year.[194]\nIBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBM employees for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),[195] which gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad.[196] For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners with top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company\'s CEO at internship\'s end.[197]\nThe company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).[198] Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company\'s most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBM employees annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses-paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.\nIBM\'s culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.[199] During IBM\'s management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.[200] The company\'s culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying it stands for \"I\'ve Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs,[201] others saying it stands for \"I\'m By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,[202] and others saying it stands for \"I\'m Being Mentored\" due to the company\'s open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.[203] In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing,[204] although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.[205] In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the \"Big Blue\".[206]\nIn 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing Mac as their primary work device, next to the option of a PC or a Linux distribution.[207] In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.[208]\n\nIBM alumni[edit]\nMany IBM employees have achieved notability outside of work and after leaving IBM. In business, former IBM employees include Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook,[209] former EDS CEO and politician Ross Perot, Microsoft chairman John W. Thompson, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, Gartner founder Gideon Gartner, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su,[210] Cadence Design Systems CEO Anirudh Devgan,[211] former Citizens Financial Group CEO Ellen Alemany, former Yahoo! chairman Alfred Amoroso, former AT&T CEO C.

Greene,[213] Citrix Systems co-founder Ed Iacobucci, ASOS.com chairman Brian McBride, former Lenovo CEO Steve Ward, and former Teradata CEO Kenneth Simonds.\nIn government, alumna Patricia Roberts Harris served as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Cabinet.[214] Samuel K. Skinner served as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and as the White House Chief of Staff. Alumni also include U.S. Senators Mack Mattingly and Thom Tillis; Wisconsin governor Scott Walker;[215] former U.S. Ambassadors Vincent Obsitnik (Slovakia), Arthur K. Watson (France), and Thomas Watson Jr. (Soviet Union); and former U.S. Representatives Todd Akin,[216] Glenn Andrews, Robert Garcia, Katherine Harris,[217] Amo Houghton, Jim Ross Lightfoot, Thomas J. Manton, Donald W. Riegle Jr., and Ed Zschau.\nOther former IBM employees include NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino, Canadian astronaut and former Governor General Julie Payette, noted musician Dave Matthews,[218] Harvey Mudd College president Maria Klawe, Western Governors University president emeritus Robert Mendenhall, former University of Kentucky president Lee T.

multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.[2] Microsoft\'s best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[3] and it was the world\'s largest software maker by revenue in 2022 according to Forbes Global 2000. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (parent company of Facebook).\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company\'s 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[4] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[5] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[6]\nAs of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[7] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy.[8] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[9] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia\'s devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company\'s shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[10][11] Under Nadella\'s direction, the company has also heavily expanded its gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to its three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2024.[12]\nIn 2018, Microsoft became the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, a position it has repeatedly traded with Apple in the years since.[13] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2024[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company\'s software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Microsoft\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n1972–1985: Founding\nAn Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\nPaul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[14]: 228 \nBill Gates and Paul Allen\'s Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center.\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[15] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[16] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems\'s (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[17] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[14]: 108, 112–114  Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[18] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft,\" short for micro-computer software.[19][20] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[21] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[18]\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[22] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company\'s dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[23] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[24][25]: 210  The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[14]: 232 \nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin\'s lymphoma.[26] Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin\'s disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[27] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[28]\n\n1985–1994: Windows and Office\nWindows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\nMicrosoft released Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[14]: 242–243, 246  despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM that August.[29] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[30] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[31] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[14] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[32] : 243–244  Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[33]\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[14]: 301  On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[34] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[35][36]\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice\'s Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive \'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM\'s use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft\'s use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[37]\n\n1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox\nIn 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX.\nFollowing Bill Gates\'s internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[38] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[39]\nThe company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[40][41]: 20  Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[dubious  – discuss] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet Explorer has not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[42] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign[43] and what The New York Times called \"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry\'s history,\"[44] Windows 95 quickly became a success.[45] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric\'s NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[46] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[47] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[14]: 323–324 \n\nMicrosoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox, graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC\'s 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[14]: 111, 228 [18] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well.[48][49] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp.,[50] calling the company an \"abusive monopoly.\"[51] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[30]\nOn October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.[52] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[53] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[54][55] In November 2005, the company\'s second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[56]\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[57]\n\n2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores\nCEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[58]\nHeadquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft\nReleased in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[59][60] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a \"Ribbon\" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[61] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft\'s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers.[62] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved\".[63] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[64]\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[65][66] Azure Services Platform, the company\'s entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[67] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7\'s focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[68][69][70]\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android in the United States.[71] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year.[72][73] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro,\" which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[74] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.[75] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies.

According to Aaron Tilley of The Wall Street Journal this is \"marking the biggest boardroom departure in the tech industry since the death of longtime rival and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.\"[176]\nOn January 13, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft\'s board of directors plans to hire an external law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, and to release a summary of how the company handled past allegations of misconduct against Bill Gates and other corporate executives.[177]\n\nChief executives\nBill Gates (1975–2000)\nSteve Ballmer (2000–2014)\nSatya Nadella (2014–present)\nFinancial\nFive year history graph of Nasdaq: MSFT stock on July 17, 2013[178]\nWhen Microsoft went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company\'s nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[14]: 235–236 [179][180] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[181] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[181][182] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft\'s stock remained steady for years.[182][183]\nStandard & Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[184] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft\'s Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[185] Microsoft\'s Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract\'s tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,\" suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[197]\n\nSubsidiaries\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[198] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.\n\nOwnership\nThe 10 largest shareholder of Microsoft in early 2024 were:[187]\n\n\n\nShareholder name\n\nPercentage\n\n\nThe Vanguard Group\n\n8.9%\n\n\nBlackRock\n\n5.6%\n\n\nState Street Corporation\n\n4.0%\n\n\nFidelity Investments\n\n2.9%\n\n\nGeode Capital Management\n\n2.1%\n\n\nT.

After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[202][203] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[204][205]\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[206] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft\'s chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled,\" attempt to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google\'s paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign,[207] while Google employees have embraced it.[208]\n\nLayoffs\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[209][210] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[211] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with eliminating 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[212] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[213] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[214]\nMicrosoft laid off 1,900 employees in its gaming division in January 2024. The layoffs primarily affected Activision Blizzard employees, but some Xbox and ZeniMax employees were also affected.[215] Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and Blizzard\'s chief design officer Allen Adham also resigned.[216]\n\nUnited States government\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[217] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA\'s massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[218] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[219] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don\'t participate in it.\"[220]\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[221] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers\' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an \'advanced persistent threat,\' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[222] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft\'s encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program, they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[223] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[224]\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company\'s and customers\' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\nSecurity challenges\nOn a Friday afternoon in January 2024, Microsoft disclosed that a Russian state-sponsored group hacked into its corporate systems. The group, accessed \"a very small percentage\" of Microsoft corporate email accounts, which also included members of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity and legal teams.[225] Microsoft noted in a blog post that the attack might have been prevented if the accounts in question had enabled multi-factor authentication, a defensive measure which is widely recommended in the industry, including by Microsoft itself.[226]\n\nCorporate identity\nCorporate culture\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft Systems Journal (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[227][228] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[229] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[230] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[231]\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[232] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I\'m [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[233]\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I\'d certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[234] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[235]\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[236]\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[237] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[238]\n\nEnvironment\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said, \"We are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,\"[239] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.\"[240] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[241]\nMicrosoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace\'s Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[242] Microsoft\'s timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products was 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011,[update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[243][needs update]\nMicrosoft\'s main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[244] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world\'s largest private bus systems, the \"Connector,\" to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The \"Connector\" does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[245]\nMicrosoft also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[244][246] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[247] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World\'s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[248]\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[249][250][251] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[252] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA\'s Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company\'s use of 100 percent renewable energy since 2014.[258]\nIn September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[259][260]\n\nHeadquarters\nBuilding 92, home to the Microsoft Visitor Center\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[261] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[262] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[263] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[264]\nIn April 2024, it was announced that Microsoft would be opening a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence \'hub\' around Paddington in London, England. It was announced that the division would be led by Jordan Hoffman, who previously worked for Deepmind and Inflection. [265]\n\nFlagship stores\nMicrosoft\'s Toronto flagship store\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[266] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[267] The company\'s retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[268] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney\'s Pitt Street Mall.[269]\n\nLogo\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"Pac-Man Logo,\" designed by Scott Baker, on February 26, 1987, with the concept being similar to InFocus Corporation logo that was adapted a year earlier in 1986. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed.\"[270] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.[271]\nMicrosoft\'s logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of \"Where do you want to go today?\"[272][273][274] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company\'s next tagline, \"Be What\'s Next.\"[275] They also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[276] The Microsoft Pac-Man logo was used for 25 years, 5 months, and 28 days until August 23, 2012, being the longest logo to be used by the company.\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company\'s shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[277] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft\'s four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[278] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[279][280]\n\n\nMicrosoft logo history\n\n\nApril 4, 1975 – 1980: First Microsoft logo\n\n\n\n1980–June 25, 1982: Second Microsoft logo\n\n\n\nJune 25, 1982 – February 26, 1987: Third Microsoft logo\n\n\n\nFebruary 26, 1987 – August 23, 2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker[272][273]\n\n\n\nAugust 23, 2012–present: Fifth and current Microsoft logo[281]\n\n\nSponsorship\nToyota Yaris WRC\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland\'s national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015.[282]\nThe company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020).\nThe company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 2015, Microsoft Philanthropies, an internal charitable organization, was established. Its mission is to bring the benefits of technology to parts of the world and segments of the population that have been denied the benefits of the digital revolution. Key areas of focus: donating cloud computing resources to university researchers and nonprofit groups; supporting the expansion of broadband access worldwide; funding international computer science education through YouthSpark; supporting tech education in the U.S. from kindergarten to high school; and donating to global child and refugee relief organizations.[283][284]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft\'s president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[285]\nDuring 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Russian government and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[286][287]\n\nControversies\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company\'s software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary,\" and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[288] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop\", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article,[289] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft\'s own employees.[290] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\nAs reported by several news outlets,[291][292] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for \'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[292]\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%.\" When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[293][294] In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to mis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade.[295]\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[296] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[297] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[298] that was used internally by Microsoft[299] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by The Guardian[300] and The Washington Post[301] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[302] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[303]\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[304]\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[305]\n\nSee also\nPortals: Companies Telecommunication Electronics Technology\nList of Microsoft software\nMicrosoft hardware\nList of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\nMicrosoft engineering groups\nMicrosoft Enterprise Agreement\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

It has been the largest publicly held food company in the world, measured by revenue and other metrics, since 2014.[6][7][8][9][10][excessive citations] It ranked No. 64 on the Fortune Global 500 in 2017.[11] In 2023, the company was ranked 50th in the Forbes Global 2000.[12]\nNestlé\'s products include baby food (some including human milk oligosaccharides), medical food, bottled water, breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, confectionery, dairy products, ice cream, frozen food, pet foods, and snacks. Twenty-nine of Nestlé\'s brands have annual sales of over 1 billion CHF (about US$1.1 billion),[13] including Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, Stouffer\'s, Vittel, and Maggi. Nestlé has 447 factories, operates in 189 countries, and employs around 339,000 people.[14] It is one of the main shareholders of L\'Oreal, the world\'s largest cosmetics company.[15]\nNestlé was formed in 1905 by the merger of the \"Anglo-Swiss Milk Company\", which was established in 1866 by brothers George and Charles Page, and \"Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé\" founded in 1867 by Henri Nestlé.[16] The company grew significantly during World War I and again following World War II, expanding its offerings beyond its early condensed milk and infant formula products. The company has made a number of corporate acquisitions including Crosse & Blackwell in 1960, Findus in 1963, Libby\'s in 1971, Rowntree Mackintosh in 1988, Klim in 1998, and Gerber in 2007.\nThe company has been associated with various controversies, facing criticism and boycotts over its marketing of baby formula as an alternative to breastfeeding in developing countries (where clean water may be scarce), its reliance on child labour in cocoa production, and its production and promotion of bottled water.\n\n\nHistory\n1866–1900: Founding and early years\nHenri Nestlé (1814–1890), a German-born Swiss confectioner, was the founder of Nestlé and one of the main creators of condensed milk.\nNestlé\'s origin dates back to the 1860s when two separate Swiss enterprises were founded that would later form Nestlé. In the following decades, the two competing enterprises expanded their businesses throughout Europe and the United States.[17]\n\nTimeline\n1866: Charles Page (US consul to Switzerland) and George Page, brothers from Lee County, Illinois established the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham, Switzerland. The company\'s first British operation was opened at Chippenham, Wiltshire in 1873.[18][19]\n1867: In Vevey, Switzerland, Henri Nestlé developed milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it. The following year, Daniel Peter began seven years of work perfecting the milk chocolate manufacturing process. Nestlé had the solution Peter needed to fix his problem of removing all the water from the milk added to his chocolate, thus preventing the product from developing mildew.\n1875: Henri Nestlé retired; the company, under new ownership, retained his name as Société Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé.[citation needed]\n1877: Anglo-Swiss added milk-based baby foods to its products; in the following year, the Nestlé Company added condensed milk to its portfolio, which made the firms direct rivals.\n1879: Nestlé merged with milk chocolate inventor Daniel Peter.[20]\n1890: Henri Nestlé died.\n1901–1989: Mergers\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Henri Nestlé and his successors participated in the development of the chocolate industry in Switzerland, together with the Peter, Kohler, and Cailler families.[21] In 1904, Daniel Peter and Charles-Amédée Kohler (son of Charles-Amédée Kohler who founded a chocolate factory in 1830) became partners and founded the Société générale suisse des chocolats Peter et Kohler réunis. In 1911, the company created by Peter and Kohler merged with Cailler.[22] Alexandre Cailler (grandson of François-Louis Cailler) had founded a chocolate factory in Broc in 1898, still used by Nestlé today; which enabled the production of milk chocolate on a large scale. In 1929, Peter, Cailler, Kohler, Chocolats Suisses finally merged with the Nestlé group.[23][24] An earlier alliance in 1904 between Peter and Nestlé also allowed the production of milk chocolate in the United States, at the Fulton plant.[25]\nIn 1905, Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss merged to become the Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, retaining that name until 1947 when the name \'Nestlé Alimentana SA\' was taken as a result of the acquisition of Fabrique de Produits Maggi SA (founded 1884) and its holding company, Alimentana SA, of Kempttal, Switzerland. The company\'s current name was adopted in 1977. By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain.[26] The First World War created a demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts, and by the end of the war, Nestlé\'s production had more than doubled.[citation needed]\n\nA 1915 advertisement for \"Nestlés Food\", an early infant formulaCertificate for 100 shares of the Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., issued 1. November 1918\nIn January 1919, Nestlé bought two condensed milk plants in Oregon from the company Geibisch and Joplin for $250,000. One was in Bandon, while the other was in Milwaukie. They expanded them considerably, processing 250,000 pounds of condensed milk daily in the Bandon plant.[27]\n\nAleppo Nestlé building Tilal street 1920s\nAfter the World War I, government contracts dried up, and consumers switched back to fresh milk. However, Nestlé\'s management responded quickly, streamlining operations and reducing debt. The 1920s saw Nestlé\'s first expansion into new products, with chocolate-manufacture becoming the company\'s second most important activity; white chocolate was created in the following decade. Louis Dapples was CEO till 1937 when succeeded by Édouard Muller till his death in 1948.\nNestlé felt the effects of the Second World War immediately. Profits dropped from US$20 million in 1938 to US$6 million in 1939.[28] Factories were established in developing countries, particularly in South America.[29] Ironically, the war helped with the introduction of the company\'s newest product, Nescafé (\"Nestlé\'s Coffee\"), which became a staple drink of the US military. Despite that, Nestlé actually supplied both sides in the war: the company had a contract to feed the German army. Nestlé\'s production and sales rose in the wartime economy.[29]\n\nThe logo that Nestlé used from 1938 to 1966[30]\nThe end of World War II was the beginning of a dynamic phase for Nestlé. Growth accelerated and numerous companies were acquired. In 1947 Nestlé merged with Maggi, a manufacturer of seasonings and soups. Crosse & Blackwell followed in 1950, as did Findus (1963), Libby\'s (1971), and Stouffer\'s (1973).[31] Diversification came under chairman & CEO Pierre Liotard-Vogt with a shareholding in L\'Oreal in 1974 and the acquisition of Alcon Laboratories Inc. in 1977 for $280 million.[31]\nIn the 1980s, Nestlé\'s improved bottom line allowed the company to launch further acquisitions. Carnation was acquired for US$3 billion in 1984 and brought the evaporated milk brand, as well as Coffee-Mate and Friskies, to Nestlé. In 1986, the company founded Nestlé Nespresso S.A. The British confectionery company Rowntree Mackintosh was acquired in 1988 for $4.5 billion, which brought brands such as Kit Kat, Rolo, Smarties, and Aero.[32]\n\n1990–2011: Growth internationally\nThe first half of the 1990s proved to be favourable for Nestlé. Trade barriers crumbled, and world markets developed into more or less integrated trading areas. Since 1996, there have been various acquisitions, including San Pellegrino (1997), D\'Onofrio (1997), Spillers Petfoods (1998), and Ralston Purina (2002). There were two major acquisitions in North America, both in 2002 – in June, Nestlé merged its US ice cream business into Dreyer\'s, and in August, a US$2.6 billion acquisition was announced of Chef America, the creator of Hot Pockets. In the same time-frame, Nestlé entered in a joint bid with Cadbury and came close to purchasing the American company Hershey\'s, one of its fiercest confectionery competitors, but the deal eventually fell through.[33]\nIn December 2005, Nestlé bought the Greek company Delta Ice Cream for €240 million.[34] In January 2006, it took full ownership of Dreyer\'s, thus becoming the world\'s largest ice cream maker, with a 17.5% market share.[35] In June 2006, Nestlé purchased weight-loss company Jenny Craig for US$600 million.[36] In July 2007, completing a deal announced the year before, Nestlé acquired the Medical Nutrition division of Novartis Pharmaceutical for US$2.5 billion and also acquiring the milk-flavoring product known as Ovaltine, the \"Boost\" and \"Resource\" lines of nutritional supplements, and Optifast dieting products.[37]\n\nThe Brazilian president, Lula da Silva, inaugurates a factory in Feira de Santana (Bahia), in February 2007.\nIn April 2007, returning to its roots, Nestlé bought US baby-food manufacturer Gerber for US$5.5 billion.[38][39][40] In December 2007, Nestlé entered into a strategic partnership with a Belgian chocolate maker, Pierre Marcolini.[41]\nNestlé agreed to sell its controlling stake in Alcon to Novartis on 4 January 2010. The sale was to form part of a broader US$39.3 billion offer by Novartis for full acquisition of the world\'s largest eye-care company.[42] On 1 March 2010, Nestlé concluded the purchase of Kraft Foods\'s North American frozen pizza business for US$3.7 billion.\nSince 2010, Nestlé has been working to transform itself into a nutrition, health and wellness company in an effort to combat declining confectionery sales and the threat of expanding government regulation of such foods. This effort is being led through the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences under the direction of Ed Baetge. The institute aims to develop \"a new industry between food and pharmaceuticals\" by creating foodstuffs with preventive and corrective health properties that would replace pharmaceutical drugs from pill bottles. The Health Science branch has already produced several products, such as drinks and protein shakes meant to combat malnutrition, diabetes, digestive health, obesity, and other diseases.[43]\nIt acquired British pharmaceutical company Vitaflo, which makes clinical nutritional products for people with genetic disorders, in August of 2010.[44] In July 2011, Nestlé SA agreed to buy 60 percent of Hsu Fu Chi International Ltd. for about US$1.7 billion.[45] On 23 April 2012, Nestlé agreed to acquire Pfizer Inc.\'s infant-nutrition, formerly Wyeth Nutrition, unit for US$11.9 billion, topping a joint bid from Danone and Mead Johnson.[46][47][48]\n\n2012–present\nIn recent years, Nestlé Health Science has made several acquisitions: CM&D Pharma Ltd., a company that specialises in the development of products for patients with chronic conditions like kidney disease; and Prometheus Laboratories, a firm specialising in treatments for gastrointestinal diseases and cancer. It also holds a minority stake in Vital Foods, a New Zealand-based company that develops kiwifruit-based food products as of 2012.[49]\nNestlé sold its Jenny Craig business unit to North Castle Partners in 2013.[50] In February 2013, Nestlé Health Science bought Pamlab, which makes medical foods based on L-methylfolate targeting depression, diabetes, and memory loss.[51] In February 2014, Nestlé sold its PowerBar sports nutrition business to Post Holdings, Inc.[52] Later, in November 2014, Nestlé announced that it was exploring strategic options for its frozen food subsidiary, Davigel.[53]\nIn December 2014, Nestlé announced that it was opening 10 skin care research centres worldwide, deepening its investment in a faster-growing market for healthcare products. That year, Nestlé spent about $350 million on dermatology research and development. The first of the research hubs, Nestlé Skin Health Investigation, Education and Longevity Development (SHIELD) centres, will open mid 2015 in New York, followed by Hong Kong and São Paulo, and later others in North America, Asia, and Europe. The initiative is being launched in partnership with the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), a consortium that includes companies such as Intel and Bank of America.[54]\nIn January 2017, Nestlé announced that it was relocating its US headquarters from Glendale, California, to Rosslyn, Virginia, outside of Washington, DC.[55]\nIn March 2017, Nestlé announced that they will lower the sugar content in Kit Kat, Yorkie and Aero chocolate bars by 10% by 2018.[56] In July, a similar announcement followed concerning the reduction of sugar content in its breakfast cereals in the UK.[57]\nThe company announced a $20.8 billion share buyback in June 2017, following the publication of a letter written by Third Point Management founder Daniel S. Loeb, Nestlé\'s fourth-largest stakeholder with a $3.5 billion stake,[58] explaining how the firm should change its business structure.[59] Consequently, the firm will reportedly focus investment on sectors such as coffee and pet care and will seek acquisitions in the consumer health-care industry.[59]\nIn 2016, Nestlé and PAI Partners establish a joint venture, Froneri, to combine the two companies\' ice cream activities throughout Europe and other international countries.[60]\nIn July 2017, Nestlé introduced a new type of infant formula in Spain, containing two human milk oligosaccharides.[61] Oligosaccharides are the third most abundant components of breast milk with various health benefits, but previously were not part of infant formula.\nIn September 2017, Nestlé S.A. acquired a majority stake of Blue Bottle Coffee.[62] While the deal\'s financial details were not disclosed, the Financial Times reported \"Nestlé is understood to be paying up to $500m for the 68 per cent stake in Blue Bottle\".[63]\nIn September 2017, Nestlé USA agreed to acquire Sweet Earth, a California-based producer of plant-based foods, for an undisclosed sum.[64]\nIn January 2018, Nestlé USA announced it was selling its US confectionary business to Ferrara Candy Company, an Italian chocolate and candy maker.[65] The company was sold for a total of an estimated $2.8 billion.[65]\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Nestlé and Starbucks struck a $7.15 billion distribution deal, which allows Nestlé to market, sell and distribute Starbucks coffee globally and to incorporate the brand\'s coffee varieties into Nestlé\'s proprietary single-serve system, expanding the overseas markets for both companies.[66]\nNestlé set a new profit target in September 2017 and agreed to offload over 20 of its US candy brands in January 2018. However, sales grew only 2.4% in 2017, and as of July 2018, the share price declined more than 8%. While some suggestions were adopted, Loeb said in a July 2018 letter that the shifts are too small and too slow. In a statement, Nestlé wrote that it was \"delivering results\" and listed actions it had taken, including investing in key brands and its global coffee partnership with Starbucks. However, activist investors disagreed, leading Third Point Management to launch NestleNOW, a website to push its case with recommendations calling for change, accusing Nestlé of not being as fast, aggressive, or strategic as it needs to be. Activist investors called for Nestlé to divide into three units with distinct CEOs, regional structures, and marketing heads - beverage, nutrition, and grocery; spin off more businesses that do not fit its model such as ice cream, frozen foods, and confectionery; and add an outsider with expertise in the food and beverage industry to the board.[67][68]\nIn September 2018, Nestlé announced that it would sell Gerber Life Insurance for $1.55 billion.[69][70]\nIn October 2018, Nestlé announced the launch of the Nestlé Alumni Network, through a strategic partnership with SAP & EnterpriseAlumni, to engage with their over 1 million alumni globally.[71]\nIn 2019, the company announced that it would publish Nutri-Score on all of its products sold in the European countries that supported the nutritional label.[72]\nIn 2020, Nestlé USA\'s and Nestlé Canada\'s ice cream divisions were acquired by Froneri.[73] Also during that year, Nestlé announced that the company wants to invest in plant-based food, starting with a \"tuna salad\" and meat-free products to engage and reach younger and vegan consumers.[74]\nNestle is expanding manufacturing capacity in India and increasing investments — the company will invest between ₹60-65 billion ($723-783 million) from 2020 to 2025.[75]\nOn 16 February 2021, Nestlé announced that it had agreed to sell its water brands in the US and Canada to One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Co. The sale would include the spring water and mountain brands, the purified water brand and the delivery service. The plan did not include the Perrier, S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna brands.[76][77] In early April 2021, the sale was concluded.[78]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not affect Nestlé negatively. Due to lockdowns, people bought more packaged foods, not only coffee and dairy products, but also pet products, which increased the company\'s sales. Nestlé is recording its strongest quarterly sales growth in 10 years.[79]\nIn April 2021, Nestlé agreed to purchase the vitamin manufacturing Bountiful Company, formerly known as The Nature\'s Bounty Co., for $5.75 billion, noting as well that much of the company\'s[which?] growth that quarter came from \"vitamins, minerals, and supplements that support health and the immune system\". Bountiful\'s brands included Nature\'s Bounty, Solgar, Osteo Bi-Flex, and Puritan\'s Pride.[80][81][82]\nIn July 2021, Vitaflo International Ltd. (subsidiary to Nestlé Health Science since 2010) acquired the Dr. Schär brands, Mevalia and ComidaMed, wich are used for the dietary management of IEM and cow’s milk protein allergy to complement Vitaflo’s existing IEM product portfolio.[83]\nIn January 2022, Nestlé will pay cocoa farmers cash if they send their children to school.[84]\nIn May 2022, it was announced Nestlé\'s Health Science unit had acquired the Brazilian organic, natural, plant-based food maker Puravida.[85]\nIn May 2022, Nestlé was sending baby formula supplies to the U.S. from European air bases to ease the 2022 United States infant formula shortage.  These relief shipments included products from the Gerber baby food formula brand from the Netherlands and Alfamino baby formula from Switzerland.[86]\nIn September 2023, it was announced Nestlé had acquired a majority stake in the Extrema, Minas Gerais-headquartered premium chocolate manufacturer, Grupo CRM for an undisclosed amount.[87]\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the company continued doing business in Russia; therefore in November 2023, Ukraine\'s National Agency on Corruption Prevention listed Nestlé as an International Sponsor of War. Nestle stated that it had already \"halted all non-essential imports and exports to and from Russia\".[88]\n\nCorporate affairs and governance\nNestlé Japan headquarters in Nestlé House building, Kobe, Japan\nNestlé USA headquarters at 1812 N Moore in Arlington, Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital ownership of Nestlé by country of origin as of 2023:[89]\n\n  Switzerland (46.6%)  United States (31.2%)  All others (22.2%)\n\n\nNestlé is the biggest food company in the world, with a market capitalisation of roughly 231 billion Swiss francs, which is more than US$247 billion as of May 2015.[90] Nestlé has a primary listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange and is a constituent of the Swiss Market Index.

For example, in South Australia the company engages Etched Communications.[102] In the US, Nestlé has a strong influence in Washington, D.C. From 2015 to 2020 their average spend on lobbying was $1,951,667 each year.[103]\n\nProducts\nMain article: List of Nestlé brands\nSamples of Nestlé Toll House Cafe items in 2012\nNestlé currently has over 2,000 brands[104][105] with a wide range of products across a number of markets, including coffee, bottled water, milkshakes and other beverages, breakfast cereals, infant foods, performance and healthcare nutrition, seasonings, soups and sauces, frozen and refrigerated foods, and pet food.[14] In 2019, the company entered the plant-based food production business with its Incredible and Awesome Burgers (under the Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth brands). In 2020, Nestlé announced additional plant-based products including soy-based bratwurst and chorizo-like sausages.[106]\n\nSponsorships\nMusic and entertainment\nIn 1993, plans were made to update and modernise the overall tone of Walt Disney\'s EPCOT Center, including a major refurbishment of The Land pavilion. Kraft Foods withdrew its sponsorship on 26 September 1993, with Nestlé taking its place. Co-financed by Nestlé and the Walt Disney World Resort, a gradual refurbishment of the pavilion began on 27 September 1993.[107] In 2003, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of The Land; however, it was under agreement that Nestlé would oversee its own refurbishment to both the interior and exterior of the pavilion. Between 2004 and 2005, the pavilion underwent its second major refurbishment. Nestlé stopped sponsoring The Land in 2009.[108]\nOn 5 August 2010, Nestlé and the Beijing Music Festival signed an agreement to extend by three years Nestlé\'s sponsorship of this international music festival. Nestlé has been an extended sponsor of the Beijing Music Festival for 11 years since 2000. The new agreement will continue the partnership through 2013.[109]\nNestlé has partnered the Salzburg Festival in Austria for 20 years. In 2011, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of the Salzburg Festival until 2015.[110]\nTogether, they have created the \"Nestlé and Salzburg Festival Young Conductors Award\", an initiative that aims to discover young conductors globally and to contribute to the development of their careers.[111]\n\nSports\nNestlé\'s sponsorship of the Tour de France began in 2001 and the agreement was extended in 2004, a move which demonstrated the company\'s interest in the Tour. In July 2009, Nestlé Waters and the organisers of the Tour de France announced that their partnership will continue until 2013. The main promotional benefits of this partnership will spread on four key brands from Nestlé\'s product portfolio: Vittel, Powerbar, Nesquik, or Ricore.[112]\nOn 27 January 2012, the International Association of Athletics Federations announced that Nestlé will be the main sponsor for the further development of IAAF\'s Kids\' Athletics Programme, which is one of the biggest grassroots development programmes in the world of sports. The five-year sponsorship started in January 2012.[113] On 11 February 2016, Nestlé decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the IAAF\'s Kids\' Athletics Programmes because of doping and corruption allegations against the IAAF. Nestlé followed suit after other large sponsors, including Adidas, also stopped supporting the IAAF.[114]\nIn 2014, Nestlé Waters sponsored the UK leg of the Tour de France through its Buxton Natural Mineral Water brand.[115]\nIn 2002, Nestlé announced it was main sponsor for the Great Britain Lionesses Women\'s rugby league team for the team\'s second tour of Australia with its Munchies product.[116]\nNestlé supports the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) on a number of nutrition and fitness fronts, funding a Fellowship position in AIS Sports Nutrition; nutrition activities in the AIS Dining Hall; research activities; and the development of education resources for use at the AIS and in the public domain.[117]\n\n\nControversies and criticisms\nMain article: Controversies of Nestlé\nBaby formula marketing\nConcern about Nestlé\'s \"aggressive marketing\" of their breast milk substitutes, particularly in less economically developed countries (LEDCs), first arose in the 1970s.[118] Critics have accused Nestlé of discouraging mothers from breastfeeding and suggesting that their baby formula is healthier than breastfeeding.[119] This led to a boycott in the United States and Europe.[120][121]\n\nSlavery and child labour\nMultiple reports have documented the widespread use of child labour in cocoa production, as well as slavery and child trafficking, throughout West African plantations, on which Nestlé and other major chocolate companies rely.[122][123][124][125][126]\n\nFood safety\nIn late September 2008, the Hong Kong government found melamine in a Chinese-made Nestlé milk product. Six infants died from kidney damage, and a further 860 babies were hospitalised.[127][128]\nIn June 2009, an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 was linked to Nestlé\'s refrigerated cookie dough originating in a plant in Danville, Virginia.[129]\nIn May 2015, food safety regulators from the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, found that samples of Nestlé India\'s Maggi noodles had up to 17 times more than the permissible safe amount of lead, in addition to monosodium glutamate.[130][131][132]\n\nWater\nAt the second World Water Forum in 2000, Nestlé and other corporations persuaded the World Water Council to change its statement so as to reduce access to drinking water from a \"right\" to a \"need\". Nestlé continues to take control of aquifers and bottle their water for profit.[133]\nA coalition of environmental groups filed a complaint against Nestlé to the Advertising Standards of Canada after Nestlé took out full-page advertisements in October 2008 with messages claiming, \"Most water bottles avoid landfill sites and are recycled\", \"Nestlé Pure Life is a healthy, eco-friendly choice\", and, \"Bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.\"[134][135][136]\n\nCorporate social responsibility and recognition\nThis section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience.

(September 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nIn March 2011, Nestlé became the first infant formula company to meet the FTSE4Good Index criteria in full.[137]\n\nSustainability\nIn May 2006, Nestlé\'s executive board adapted the existing Nestlé management systems to full conformity with the international standards ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems) and to certify all Nestlé factories against these standards by 2010.[138]\nIn October 2009, Nestlé announced \"The Cocoa Plan\" to get 100 percent of its chocolate portfolio using certified sustainable cocoa. For third-party certification, Nestlé has partnered with UTZ Certified. Many of Nestlé\'s efforts are focused on the Ivory Coast, where 40 percent of the world\'s cocoa comes from. The company has developed a higher-yielding, more drought- and disease-resistant cocoa tree; and they have given 3 million of these trees to farmers thus far and plan[when?] to give away 12 million of them in total. They are also training farmers in efficient and sustainable growing techniques, which focuses on better farming practices, including pruning trees, pest control (with an emphasis on integrated pest management) and harvesting, as well as caring for the environment. In addition, they have built 23 new schools so far and plan to build 40 in total by 2015.[139][needs update] Another part of the plan has been to address child labor. Nestlé says that according to US statistics, there are about 800,000 children who work the cocoa supply chain. Nestlé approached the Fair Labor Association to map out strategies to help curb child labor in the cocoa sector, and these efforts – including community education and the building of schools – have become a focus of the Cocoa Plan.[139]\nIn 2020, Nestlé Waters joined a consortium to boost PET plastic recyclability.[140]\n\nEconomy and Development\nNestlé also established the Creating Shared Value Prize, which is awarded every other year with the aim of rewarding the best examples of CSV initiatives worldwide and to encourage other companies to adopt a shared value approach. These initiatives should take a business-oriented approach in addressing challenges in nutrition, water or rural development. The winner can win up to CHF 500,000. Nestlé was an early mover in the shared value space and hosts a global forum, the Creating Shared Value Global Forum.[141][142]\nRural Development Framework program: In 2012, Nestlé developed the Rural Development Framework, which supports farmers and cocoa growing communities.[143] It is an investment program aimed at improving infrastructure, increasing access to safe water, address financing and market efficiency gaps, and improving labor conditions.[144]\n\nPublic health\nHealth care and nutrition product development: In September 2010, Nestlé said that it would invest more than $500 million between 2011 and 2020 to develop health and wellness products to help prevent and treat major ailments like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer\'s. Nestlé created a wholly owned subsidiary, Nestlé Health Science, as well as a research body, the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences.[145]\n\nAwards\n\n\nYear\n\nBrand\n\nAward\n\nResult\n\n\n2010\n\nNestlé Purina\n\nMalcolm Baldrige National Quality Award\n\nWon\n\n\n2010\n\n—\n\nIUoFST Gold Food Industry Award[146]\n\nWon\n\n\n2011\n\n—\n\nWorld Environment Center Gold Medal Award\n\nWon\n\n\n2014\n\n—\n\nHenry Spira Corporate Progress Award\n\nWon\n\nSee also\n\nBusiness portal\nBig Chocolate\nCerelac\nFarfel the Dog\nNestlé Smarties Book Prize\nNestlé Tower\nUltra-processed food\nCompetitors\n\nDanone\nFerrero SpA\nHershey\'s\nKellogg\'s\nKraft Heinz\nMars, Incorporated\nMondelez International\nPepsiCo\nUnilever\nExplanatory notes\n\n\n^ Not to be confused with Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., the group\'s intellectual property-holding subsidiary\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b \"Management\".

The Nestlé S.A. facility in Broc, Switzerland, is steeped in the tradition of fine chocolate manufacturing as a company that has played an important part in industry history. [...] Cailler brand and his signature is still embossed on chocolate. In Switzerland, Cailler is the leading chocolate brand. Charles-Amedee Kohler (1790-1874) began producing chocolate in 1830. The Kohler firm later merged with that of Daniel Peter. Daniel Peter (1836-1919), who became the son-in-law of Francois Louis Cailler, assured his place in chocolate industry history with his invention in 1875 of milk chocolate. Henri Nestlé had first become an important manufacturer of milk products. Among his accomplishments was the development of a process to produce condensed milk which would be used in the making of milk chocolate. It wasn\'t until 1929 that these pioneering companies agreed to merge, but the plant at Broc had been built by the Cailler family in 1898. The selection of a site in Broc was made deliberately to locate it in Switzerland\'s picturesque Gruyere region, renowned for its fine milk production.\n\n^ Lacey, Darlene (2013).

As of 2016, it was a growing sector in the global chocolate industry. Organic chocolate is a socially desirable product for some consumers.[1][2]  Major brands, such as The Hershey Company, have begun to produce organic chocolate.[3]\n\n\nSources[edit]\nMany, if not most, producers of organic chocolate source their ingredients from certified fair trade cocoa farms and cooperatives.[4] Organic chocolate comes in many varieties, including milk chocolate, white chocolate, and dark chocolate. Major brands of organic chocolate include Britain-based Green & Black\'s, Hershey-owned Dagoba Chocolate, and Equal Exchange.[5]  Less-known retailers include Taza Chocolate, Pacari Chocolate, and Sacred Chocolate, a brand noted for producing raw chocolate.[6]\n\nProduction process[edit]\nThe Seattle-based chocolate maker Theo Chocolate was one of the first companies that were \"fair-trade certified\" and produced organic chocolate. In 2006 Theo Chocolate began their production of organic chocolate, there were no solid guidelines for chocolate manufacturing at the time and they had to get the process and ingredients in the correct measurements. The main ingredient in chocolate, cocoa is found close to the equator and the majority of it is grown in Western Africa or South America. The organic cocoa, the main ingredient in organic chocolate, is sent to the chocolate factory, where it arrives in burlap sacks. The cocoa beans are then thoroughly cleaned and foreign objects are removed until just the beans remain. The manufacturer makes sure to use all organic ingredients to ensure that the final product is truly organic.[7]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nFood portal\n\nRaw chocolate\nEnvironmental impact of cocoa production\nFair trade cocoa\nTropical rainforest conservation\nTypes of chocolate\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Organic chocolate.\n\n\n\n^ Mitch Lipka (11 February 2015). \"Is organic chocolate worth the price?\".

Cultivation of cacao spread across the region, encompassing areas of modern-day Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America[1]\nCacao held a central role in indigenous cultures, where it was not only prized for its taste but also imbued with ritual and social significance. Among diverse communities, from the Mayans to the Aztecs, cacao was viewed as a sacred substance, consumed in ceremonial contexts and esteemed for its perceived medicinal and spiritual properties.[1]\nAs a beverage, chocolate became a symbol of unity and hospitality, enjoyed in communal gatherings and offered as a sign of goodwill. However, the arrival of the Spanish in the early sixteenth century marked a pivotal moment in the history of cacao.[2] Chocolate was introduced to Europe in the seventeenth century and was marketed as an \"Indian Drink\" because a large portion of cocoa beans were imported from the West Indies, today known as the Caribbean region.[3]\nWith the onset of colonisation, the Spanish recognized the economic potential of cacao and began to develop its trade on a global scale. Utilising indigenous labor and implementing colonial policies, the Spanish established cacao plantations in regions such as present-day Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. This expansion of cacao cultivation transformed it from a local delicacy into a valuable commodity for international trade.[1]\n\nProduction[edit]\nChocolate\'s quality is heavily impacted by the basic raw materials and various steps of its manufacturing process. Traditional chocolate-making steps include conching, tempering, emulsification, flavouring, fermentation, drying, roasting, and grinding cocoa seeds, which are then combined with materials such as cocoa mass, sugar, cocoa butter, and, in certain cases, milk components.[4] Crucial chemical reactions occur throughout these processes, particularly during fermentation, drying, roasting, and conching, which have a substantial impact on the final product\'s flavour and texture. Furthermore, these stages cause chemical changes that alter the biological properties of cocoa seeds.\nIn contrast to traditional chocolate, which requires roasted cocoa beans, raw chocolate is produced using unroasted cocoa beans, cocoa butter, and cane sugar. This differs from regular chocolate where the cocoa beans must be roasted. Keeping the cocoa beans unroasted is believed to give raw chocolate more health benefits than regular chocolate due to its high magnesium level ad alternative sugars.[4] Because of the precision required to make raw chocolate, the beans must not exceed 48 degrees Celsius. \nCrushing and deshelling cocoa beans, refining cane sugar, and conching cocoa butter are all steps in the raw chocolate production process, followed by moulding and refining the combination at a regulated temperature over several weeks.  The chocolate is then tempered, crystallised, taken from the mould, and packaged. Raw cocoa has been linked to a variety of health advantages, including relaxation, due to its high magnesium content.[4]\n\nPopularity[edit]\nRaw chocolate represents a fast-growing segment of the chocolate industry. It is often made in small batches. It has been promoted as having higher concentrations of some nutrients,[5] although few studies have been conducted to support this.[5] According to research, more than 200 ingredients, found in chocolate and cocoa tree seeds (beans), may promote health and wellbeing. However, several of those chemicals—like serotonin, phenylethylamine, and acylethanolamines—do not exist in sufficient concentrations to have a positive impact on health.[4] The low-heat or \"cold\" production process (which avoids roasting) may help to preserve the polyphenols present in cocoa.[6] Many marketers produce raw chocolate that is certified organic or fairly-traded.[7]\nThe aphrodisiac and anti-depressive qualities combined with specific sensory aspects of chocolate extend its effects beyond the cardiovascular system, metabolic diseases, neurological problems, and psychological profiles. Moreover, the potential health advantages of antioxidants and other substances found in the phytochemical composition of dark chocolate and cocoa have garnered more attention in the last fifteen years.[4]\nAs of 2018, the world\'s yearly consumption of cacao was estimated to be 4.6 million metric tons, a 3.9% increase from 2017.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nFood portal\n\nFair trade cocoa\nDark chocolate\nOrganic chocolate\nHealth effects of chocolate\nRaw foodism\nTypes of chocolate\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c Norton, Marcy (June 2006). \"Tasting Empire: Chocolate and the European Internalization of Mesoamerican Aesthetics\" (PDF).

Its name derives from the Osage language, and refers to their relatives, the Quapaw people.[11] The state\'s diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.\nArkansas is the 29th largest by area and the 34th most populous state, with a population of just over three million at the 2020 census.[5] The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, in the central part of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, including the Fayettevilleâ€“Springdaleâ€“Rogers Metropolitan Area and Fort Smith metropolitan area, is a population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the state\'s eastern part is Jonesboro. The largest city in the state\'s southeastern part is Pine Bluff.\nPreviously part of French Louisiana and the Louisiana Purchase, the Territory of Arkansas was admitted to the Union as the 25th state on June 15, 1836.[12] Much of the Delta had been developed for cotton plantations, and landowners there largely depended on enslaved African Americans\' labor. In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. On returning to the Union in 1868, Arkansas continued to suffer economically, due to its overreliance on the large-scale plantation economy. Cotton remained the leading commodity crop, and the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in economic opportunity. In the late 19th century, the state instituted various Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and segregate the African-American population. White interests dominated Arkansas\'s politics, with disenfranchisement of African Americans and refusal to reapportion the legislature; only after the federal legislation passed were more African Americans able to vote. During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Arkansas and particularly Little Rock were major battlegrounds for efforts to integrate schools.\nFollowing World War II in the 1940s, Arkansas began to diversify its economy and see prosperity. During the 1960s, the state became the base of the Walmart corporation, the world\'s largest company by revenue, headquartered in Bentonville. In the 21st century, Arkansas\'s economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, soybeans and rice.\nArkansas\'s culture is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. Notable people from the state include politician and educational advocate William Fulbright; former president Bill Clinton, who also served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas; general Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander; Walmart founder and magnate Sam Walton;[13] singer-songwriters Johnny Cash, Charlie Rich, Jimmy Driftwood, and Glen Campbell; actor-filmmaker Billy Bob Thornton; poet C. D. Wright; physicist William L. McMillan, a pioneer in superconductor research; poet laureate Maya Angelou; Douglas MacArthur; musician Al Green; actor Alan Ladd; basketball player Scottie Pippen; singer Ne-Yo; Chelsea Clinton; actress Sheryl Underwood; and author John Grisham.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n\n\n\nPronunciation of Arkansas\nDuration: 2 seconds.0:02\n\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\n\nThe name Arkansas initially applied to the Arkansas River. It derives from a French term, Arcansas, their plural term for their transliteration of akansa, an Algonquian term for the Quapaw people.[14] These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who settled in Arkansas around the 13th century. Kansa is likely also the root term for Kansas, which was named after the related Kaw people.[14]\nThe name has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of ways.[c] In 1881, the state legislature defined the official pronunciation of Arkansas as having the final \"s\" be silent (as it would be in French). A dispute had arisen between the state\'s two senators over the pronunciation issue. One favored /ËˆÉ‘ËrkÉ™nsÉ”Ë/ (AR-kÉ™n-saw), the other /É‘ËrËˆkÃ¦nzÉ™s/ (ar-KAN-zÉ™s).[c]\nIn 2007, the state legislature passed a non-binding resolution declaring that the possessive form of the state\'s name is Arkansas\'s, which the state government has increasingly followed.[16][17]\n\nHistory\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The Caddo, Osage, and Quapaw peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, Quigualtam. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day McArthur, Arkansas, in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs\" which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former aide-de-camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.[18][19]\nLater explorers included the French Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673, and Frenchmen Robert La Salle and Henri de Tonti in 1681.[20][21] Tonti established Arkansas Post at a Quapaw village in 1686, making it the first European settlement in the territory.[22] The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the Illinois tribe\'s name for the Quapaw people, who lived downriver from them.[23][c] The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the Territory of Arkansaw on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically /ËˆÉ‘ËrkÉ™nsÉ”Ë/, /É‘ËrËˆkÃ¦nzÉ™s/, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either \"Arkansans\" or \"Arkansawyers\". In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text):\n\nWhereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.\nAnd, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.\nBe it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is an innovation to be discouraged.\nCitizens of the state of Kansas often pronounce the Arkansas River as /É‘ËrËˆkÃ¦nzÉ™s ËˆrÉªvÉ™r/, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.\nSettlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century. These people used Arkansas Post as a home base and entrepÃ´t.[22] During the colonial period, Arkansas changed hands between France and Spain following the Seven Years\' War, although neither showed interest in the remote settlement of Arkansas Post.[24] In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the American Revolutionary War, a brief siege of the post by British Captain James Colbert with the assistance of the Choctaw and Chickasaw.[25]\n\nPurchase and statehood\nMain articles: Louisiana Purchase, District of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory, Missouri Territory, Organic act Â§ List of organic acts, and Arkansas Territory\nMap of the Arkansas Territory\nNapoleon Bonaparte sold French Louisiana to the United States in 1803, including all of Arkansas, in a transaction known today as the Louisiana Purchase. French soldiers remained as a garrison at Arkansas Post. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began to change all along the frontier, including in Arkansas.[26] Following a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory, the Territory of Arkansas was organized on July 4, 1819.[c] Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the Speaker of the House Henry Clay, allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.[27]\nSlavery became a wedge issue in Arkansas, forming a geographic divide that remained for decades. Owners and operators of the cotton plantation economy in southeast Arkansas firmly supported slavery, as they perceived slave labor as the best or \"only\" economically viable method of harvesting their commodity crops.[28] The \"hill country\" of northwest Arkansas was unable to grow cotton and relied on a cash-scarce, subsistence farming economy.[29]\n\nArkansas statehood, 100th anniversary issue; released on June 15, 1936, on the 100th anniversary of Arkansas statehood. The old state house is depicted at center, the fort surrounding the Arkansas Post at left with the present day state capitol building at right.[30]\nAs European Americans settled throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest, in the 1830s the United States government forced the removal of many Native American tribes to Arkansas and Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.\nAdditional Native American removals began in earnest during the territorial period, with final Quapaw removal complete by 1833 as they were pushed into Indian Territory.[31] The capital was relocated from Arkansas Post to Little Rock in 1821, during the territorial period.[32]\n\nSee also: Admission to the Union and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\nWhen Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in Washington, D.C. Congress eventually approved the Arkansas Constitution after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836, as the 25th state and the 13th slave state, having a population of about 60,000.[33] Arkansas struggled with taxation to support its new state government, a problem made worse by a state banking scandal and worse yet by the Panic of 1837.\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction\nMain articles: Ordinance of Secession, Confederate States of America, and Arkansas in the American Civil War\nLakeport Plantation, built c.â€‰1859\nIn early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas slave-based economy developed rapidly. On the eve of the American Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state\'s population.[34] A plantation system based largely on cotton agriculture developed that, after the war, kept the state and region behind the nation for decades.[35] The wealth developed among planters of southeast Arkansas caused a political rift between the northwest and southeast.[36]\nMany politicians were elected to office from the Family, the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas. Residents generally wanted to avoid a civil war. When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, delegates to a convention called to determine whether Arkansas should secede referred the question back to the voters for a referendum to be held in August.[36] Arkansas did not secede until Abraham Lincoln demanded Arkansas troops be sent to Fort Sumter to quell the rebellion there. On May 6, the members of the state convention, having been recalled by the convention president, voted to terminate Arkansas\'s membership in the Union and join the Confederate States of America.[36]\n\nCannons at Battle of Pea Ridge site\nArkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the Mississippi River and surrounding Southern states. The bloody Battle of Wilson\'s Creek just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the Battle of Cane Hill, Battle of Pea Ridge, and Battle of Prairie Grove. Union general Samuel Curtis swept across the state to Helena in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to Hot Springs, and then again to Washington from 1863 to 1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.[37] Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.\nUnder the Military Reconstruction Act, Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the Radical Republicans and Unionists, and led by Governor Powell Clayton, they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the Ku Klux Klan fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.\n\nEnd of Reconstruction and late 19th century\nIn 1874, the Brooks-Baxter War, a political struggle between factions of the Republican Party shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President Ulysses S. Grant ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters.[38]\nFollowing the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates and effectively bringing an end to Reconstruction.\nIn 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state\'s name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)\nAfter Reconstruction, the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Chinese, Italian, and Syrian men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially, as they quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.[39]\nConstruction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, Eureka Springs in Carroll County grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town\'s attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as Hot Springs.\n\nRise of the Jim Crow laws and early 20th century\nSee also: Elaine massacre\nA group of African American boys in Little Rock in 1938.\nIn the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a poll tax and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.\nBy 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the white primary in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 to enforce constitutional rights.[40]\nBetween 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small immigration of German, Slovak, and Scots-Irish from Europe. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the Prairie, and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from Ulster, of Scots and Northern Borders descent. Some early 20th-century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.\nBlack sharecroppers began to try to organize a farmers\' union after World War I. They were seeking better conditions of payment and accounting from white landowners of the area cotton plantations. Whites resisted any change and often tried to break up their meetings. On September 30, 1919, two white men, including a local deputy, tried to break up a meeting of black sharecroppers who were trying to organize a farmers\' union. After a white deputy was killed in a confrontation with guards at the meeting, word spread to town and around the area.[citation needed] Hundreds of whites from Phillips and neighboring areas rushed to suppress the blacks, and started attacking blacks at large. Governor Charles Hillman Brough requested federal troops to stop what was called the Elaine massacre. White mobs spread throughout the county, killing an estimated 237 blacks before most of the violence was suppressed after October 1.[41] Five whites also died in the incident. The governor accompanied the troops to the scene; President Woodrow Wilson had approved their use.\n\nMap of the flood of 1927 in Arkansas\nThe Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 flooded the areas along the Ouachita Rivers along with many other rivers.\nBased on the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt given shortly after Imperial Japan\'s attack on Pearl Harbor, nearly 16,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from the West Coast of the United States and incarcerated in two internment camps in the Arkansas Delta.[42] The Rohwer Camp in Desha County operated from September 1942 to November 1945 and at its peak interned 8,475 prisoners.[42] The Jerome War Relocation Center in Drew County operated from October 1942 to June 1944 and held about 8,000.[42]\n\nFall of segregation\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled segregation in public schools unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954), some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The Little Rock Nine brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the federal government had to intervene to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the capital. Governor Orval Faubus had ordered the Arkansas National Guard to help segregationists prevent nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock\'s Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 1,000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.[43]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of Arkansas\nView from the Ozark Highlands Scenic Byway in Boxley Valley\nBoundaries\nArkansas borders Louisiana to the south, Texas to the southwest, Oklahoma to the west, Missouri to the north, and Tennessee and Mississippi to the east. The United States Census Bureau classifies Arkansas as a southern state, sub-categorized among the West South Central States.[10] The Mississippi River forms most of its eastern border, except in Clay and Greene counties, where the St. Francis River forms the western boundary of the Missouri Bootheel, and in many places where the channel of the Mississippi has meandered (or been straightened by man) from its original 1836 course.[citation needed]\n\nTerrain\nThe Ozarks rise behind a bend in the Buffalo River from an overlook on the Buffalo River Trail.\nArkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest and the lowlands of the southeast.[44] The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including The Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains. The southern lowlands include the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Arkansas Delta.[45] This split can yield to a regional division into northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, and central Arkansas. These regions are broad and not defined along county lines. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas River Valley, Gulf Coastal Plain, Crowley\'s Ridge, and the Arkansas Delta, with Central Arkansas sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.[46]\n\nThe flat terrain and rich soils of the Arkansas Delta near Arkansas City are in stark contrast to the northwestern part of the state.\nThe southeastern part of Arkansas along the Mississippi Alluvial Plain is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther from the river, in the southeastern part of the state, the Grand Prairie has a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by a geological formation known as Crowley\'s Ridge. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley\'s Ridge rises 250 to 500 feet (76 to 152 m) above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of eastern Arkansas\'s major towns.[47]\nNorthwest Arkansas is part of the Ozark Plateau including the Ozark Mountains, to the south are the Ouachita Mountains, and these regions are divided by the Arkansas River; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands.[48] These mountain ranges are part of the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.[49] The state\'s highest point is Mount Magazine in the Ouachita Mountains,[50] which is 2,753 feet (839 m) above sea level.[4]\n\nCedar Falls in Petit Jean State Park\nArkansas is home to many caves, such as Blanchard Springs Caverns. The State Archeologist has catalogued more than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool-making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters. Crater of Diamonds State Park near Murfreesboro is the world\'s only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public for digging.[51][52] Arkansas is home to a dozen Wilderness Areas totaling 158,444 acres (641.20 km2).[53] These areas are set aside for outdoor recreation and are open to hunting, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. No mechanized vehicles nor developed campgrounds are allowed in these areas.[54]\n\nHydrology\nThe Buffalo National River is one of many attractions that give the state its nickname, The Natural State\nArkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs within or along its borders. Major tributaries to the Mississippi River include the Arkansas River, the White River, and the St. Francis River.[55] The Arkansas is fed by the Mulberry and Fourche LaFave Rivers in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to Lake Dardanelle. The Buffalo, Little Red, Black and Cache Rivers are all tributaries to the White River, which also empties into the Mississippi. Bayou Bartholomew and the Saline, Little Missouri, and Caddo Rivers are all tributaries to the Ouachita River in south Arkansas, which empties into the Mississippi in Louisiana. The Red River briefly forms the state\'s boundary with Texas.[56] Arkansas has few natural lakes and many reservoirs,[quantify] such as Bull Shoals Lake, Lake Ouachita, Greers Ferry Lake, Millwood Lake, Beaver Lake, Norfork Lake, DeGray Lake, and Lake Conway.[57]\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe White River in eastern Arkansas\nArkansas\'s temperate deciduous forest is divided into three broad ecoregions: the Ozark, Ouachita-Appalachian Forests, the Mississippi Alluvial and Southeast USA Coastal Plains, and the Southeastern USA Plains.[58] The state is further divided into seven subregions: the Arkansas Valley, Boston Mountains, Mississippi Alluvial Plain, Mississippi Valley Loess Plain, Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, and the South Central Plains.[59] A 2010 United States Forest Service survey determined 18,720,000 acres (7,580,000 ha) of Arkansas\'s land is forestland, or 56% of the state\'s total area.[60] Dominant species in Arkansas\'s forests include Quercus (oak), Carya (hickory), Pinus echinata (shortleaf pine) and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine).[61][62]\nArkansas\'s plant life varies with its climate and elevation. The pine belt stretching from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region.[63] In eastern Arkansas, one can find Taxodium  (cypress), Quercus nigra (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south.[64] Nearby Crowley\'s Ridge is the only home of the tulip tree in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the beech tree.[65] The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with Ozark white cedars, cornus (dogwoods), and Cercis canadensis (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the Physematium scopulinum and Adiantum (maidenhair fern) on Mount Magazine.[66] Arkansas wildlife is famous for the white-tailed deer, elk, and bald eagle. The white-tailed deer is the official state mammal.[67]\n\nClimate\nFurther information: Climate change in Arkansas\nWinter at Historic Washington State Park in Hempstead County\nArkansas generally has a humid subtropical climate. While not bordering the Gulf of Mexico, Arkansas, is still close enough to the warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas, has hot, humid summers and slightly drier, mild to cool winters. In Little Rock, the daily high temperatures average around 93 Â°F (34 Â°C) with lows around 73 Â°F (23 Â°C) in July. In January highs average around 51 Â°F (11 Â°C) and lows around 32 Â°F (0 Â°C). In Siloam Springs in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are 89 and 67 Â°F (32 and 19 Â°C) and in January the average high and low are 44 and 23 Â°F (7 and âˆ’5 Â°C). Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 and 1,500 mm); it is somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state.[68] Snowfall is infrequent but most common in the northern half of the state.[55] The half of the state south of Little Rock is apter to see ice storms. Arkansas\'s record high is 120 Â°F (49 Â°C) at Ozark on August 10, 1936; the record low is âˆ’29 Â°F (âˆ’34 Â°C) at Gravette, on February 13, 1905.[69]\nArkansas is known for extreme weather and frequent storms. A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the Great Plains and the Gulf States, Arkansas, receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in Tornado Alley, and as a result, a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While sufficiently far from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a tropical system, which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.[citation needed]\n\n\n\nMonthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Arkansas Cities\n\n\nCity\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nAvg\n\n\nFayetteville[70]\n\n44/24(7/-4)\n\n51/29(10/-2)\n\n59/38(15/3)\n\n69/46(20/8)\n\n76/55(24/13)\n\n84/64(29/18)\n\n89/69(32/20)\n\n89/67(32/19)\n\n81/59(27/15)\n\n70/47(21/9)\n\n57/37(14/3)\n\n48/28(9/-2)\n\n68/47(20/8)\n\n\nJonesboro[71]\n\n45/26(7/-3)\n\n51/30(11/-1)\n\n61/40(16/4)\n\n71/49(22/9)\n\n80/58(26/15)\n\n88/67(31/19)\n\n92/71(34/22)\n\n91/69(33/20)\n\n84/61(29/16)\n\n74/49(23/9)\n\n60/39(15/4)\n\n49/30(10/-1)\n\n71/49(21/9)\n\n\nLittle Rock[72]\n\n51/31(11/-1)\n\n55/35(13/2)\n\n64/43(18/6)\n\n73/51(23/11)\n\n81/61(27/16)\n\n89/69(32/21)\n\n93/73(34/23)\n\n93/72(34/22)\n\n86/65(30/18)\n\n75/53(24/12)\n\n63/42(17/6)\n\n52/34(11/1)\n\n73/51(23/11)\n\n\nTexarkana[73]\n\n53/31(11/-1)\n\n58/34(15/1)\n\n67/42(19/5)\n\n75/50(24/10)\n\n82/60(28/16)\n\n89/68(32/20)\n\n93/72(34/22)\n\n93/71(34/21)\n\n86/64(30/18)\n\n76/52(25/11)\n\n64/41(18/5)\n\n55/33(13/1)\n\n74/52(23/11)\n\n\nMonticello[74]\n\n52/30(11/-1)\n\n58/34(14/1)\n\n66/43(19/6)\n\n74/49(23/10)\n\n82/59(28/15)\n\n89/66(32/19)\n\n92/70(34/21)\n\n92/68(33/20)\n\n86/62(30/17)\n\n76/50(25/10)\n\n64/41(18/5)\n\n55/34(13/1)\n\n74/51(23/10)\n\n\nFort Smith[75]\n\n48/27(8/-2)\n\n54/32(12/0)\n\n64/40(17/4)\n\n73/49(22/9)\n\n80/58(26/14)\n\n87/67(30/19)\n\n92/71(33/21)\n\n92/70(33/21)\n\n84/62(29/17)\n\n75/50(23/10)\n\n61/39(16/4)\n\n50/31(10/0)\n\n72/50(22/10)\n\n\nAverage high Â°F/average low Â°F (average high Â°C/average lowÂ°C)\n\nCities and towns\nSee also: List of cities and towns in Arkansas, Arkansas metropolitan areas, and List of townships in Arkansas\nCleveland County Courthouse in Rison\nLittle Rock has been Arkansas\'s capital city since 1821 when it replaced Arkansas Post as the capital of the Territory of Arkansas.[76] The state capitol was moved to Hot Springs and later Washington during the American Civil War when the Union armies threatened the city in 1862, and state government did not return to Little Rock until after the war ended. Today, the Little Rockâ€“North Little Rockâ€“Conway metropolitan area is the largest in the state, with a population of 724,385 in 2013.[77]\nThe Fayettevilleâ€“Springdaleâ€“Rogers Metropolitan Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in Arkansas, growing at the fastest rate due to the influx of businesses and the growth of the University of Arkansas and Walmart.[78]\nThe state has eight cities with populations above 50,000 (based on 2010 census). In descending order of size, they are Little Rock, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Springdale, Jonesboro, North Little Rock, Conway, and Rogers. Of these, only Fort Smith and Jonesboro are outside the two largest metropolitan areas.

Blue indicates population gain, purple indicates population loss, and shade indicates magnitude.\nThe United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Arkansas was 3,017,804 on July 1, 2019, a 3.49% increase since the 2010 United States census.[81] At the 2020 U.S. census, Arkansas had a resident population of 3,011,524.\nFrom fewer than 15,000 in 1820, Arkansas\'s population grew to 52,240 during a special census in 1835, far exceeding the 40,000 required to apply for statehood.[82] Following statehood in 1836, the population doubled each decade until the 1870 census conducted following the American Civil War. The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although it gradually slowed in the 20th century.\nIt recorded population losses in the 1950 and 1960 censuses. This outmigration was a result of multiple factors, including farm mechanization, decreasing labor demand, and young educated people leaving the state due to a lack of non-farming industry in the state.[83] Arkansas again began to grow, recording positive growth rates ever since and exceeding two million by the 1980 census.[84] Arkansas\'s rate of change, age distributions, and gender distributions mirror national averages. Minority group data also approximates national averages. There are fewer people in Arkansas of Hispanic or Latino origin than the national average.[85] The center of population of Arkansas for 2000 was located in Perry County, near Nogal.[86]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,459 homeless people in Arkansas.[87][88]\n\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n18101,062â€”182014,2731,244.0%183030,388112.9%184097,574221.1%1850209,897115.1%1860435,450107.5%1870484,47111.3%1880802,52565.6%18901,128,21140.6%19001,311,56416.3%19101,574,44920.0%19201,752,20411.3%19301,854,4825.8%19401,949,3875.1%19501,909,511âˆ’2.0%19601,786,272âˆ’6.5%19701,923,2957.7%19802,286,43518.9%19902,350,7252.8%20002,673,40013.7%20102,915,9189.1%20203,011,5243.3%2023 (est.)3,067,732[89]1.9%Source: 1910â€“2020[90]\n\nRace and ethnicity\nPer the 2019 census estimates, Arkansas was 72.0% non-Hispanic white, 15.4% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% Asian, 0.4% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.1% some other race, 2.4% two or more races, and 7.7% Hispanic or Latin American of any race.[91] In 2011, the state was 80.1% white (74.2% non-Hispanic white), 15.6% Black or African American, 0.9% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.3% Asian, and 1.8% from two or more races.

African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly Scots-Irish, Protestants from Northern Ireland, the Scottish lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland before the American Revolution. English and Scots-Irish immigrants settled throughout the back country of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of English stock are found throughout the state.[99]\nA 2010 survey of the principal ancestries of Arkansas\'s residents revealed the following:[100] 15.5% African American, 12.3% Irish, 11.5% German, 11.0% American, 10.1% English, 4.7% Mexican, 2.1% French, 1.7% Scottish, 1.7% Dutch, 1.6% Italian, and 1.4% Scots-Irish.\nMost people identifying as \"American\" are of English descent or Scots-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify as of Irish descent are in fact of Scots-Irish descent.[101][102][103][104]\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, in 2015, the top countries of origin for Arkansas\' immigrants were Mexico, El Salvador, India, Vietnam, and Guatemala.[105]\nAccording to the 2006â€“2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas\'s population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state\'s population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state\'s population spoke another Indo-European language. About 0.8% of the state\'s population spoke an Asian language, and 0.2% spoke other languages.[clarification needed dubious]\n\nReligion\n\n\n\nReligion in Arkansas (2014)[106]\n\nReligion\n\nPercent\n\n\nProtestant\nâ€‰\n70%\n\n\nUnaffiliated\nâ€‰\n18%\n\n\nCatholic\nâ€‰\n8%\n\n\nMuslim\nâ€‰\n2%\n\n\nMormon\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nOther\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\n\n\nLike most other Southern states, Arkansas is part of the Bible Belt and predominantly Protestant. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 661,382; the United Methodist Church with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; the Catholic Church with 122,662; and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 31,254. Some residents of the state have other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Wicca/Paganism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and some have no religious affiliation.[107]\nIn 2014, the Pew Research Center determined that 79% of the population was Christian, dominated by evangelicals in the Southern Baptist and independent Baptist churches. In contrast with many other states, the Catholic Church as of 2014 was not the largest Christian denomination in Arkansas. Of the unaffiliated population, 2% were atheist in 2014.[108] By 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 71% of the population was Christian.[109] Arkansas continued to be dominated by evangelicals, followed by mainline Protestants and historically black or African American churches.\n\nEconomy\nSee also: Economy of Arkansas, List of Arkansas companies, and Arkansas locations by per capita income\nThe Simmons Tower in Little Rock is the state\'s tallest building.\nOnce a state with a cashless society in the uplands and plantation agriculture in the lowlands, Arkansas\'s economy has evolved and diversified. The state\'s gross domestic product (GDP) was $119 billion in 2015.[110] Six Fortune 500 companies are based in Arkansas, including the world\'s #1 retailer, Walmart; Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt, Dillard\'s, Murphy USA, and Windstream are also headquartered in the state.[111] The per capita personal income in 2015 was $39,107, ranking 45th in the nation.[112] The median household income from 2011 to 2015 was $41,371, ranking 49th in the nation.[113] The state\'s agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, and paper products. Arkansas\'s mines produce natural gas, oil, crushed stone, bromine, and vanadium.[114] According to CNBC, Arkansas is the 20th-best state for business, with the 2nd-lowest cost of doing business, 5th-lowest cost of living, 11th-best workforce, 20th-best economic climate, 28th-best-educated workforce, 31st-best infrastructure and the 32nd-friendliest regulatory environment. [citation needed] Arkansas gained 12 spots in the best state for business rankings since 2011.[115] As of 2014, it was the most affordable state to live in.[citation needed]\nAs of July 2023, the state\'s unemployment rate was 2.6%; the preliminary rate for December 2023 is 3.4%.[116]\n\nIndustry and commerce\nArkansas\'s earliest industries were fur trading and agriculture, with development of cotton plantations in the areas near the Mississippi River. They were dependent on slave labor through the American Civil War.[117]\nToday only about three percent of the population are employed in the agricultural sector,[118] it remains a major part of the state\'s economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold.[119] Arkansas is the nation\'s largest producer of rice, broilers, and turkeys,[120] and ranks in the top three for cotton, pullets, and aquaculture (catfish).[119] Forestry remains strong in the Arkansas Timberlands, and the state ranks fourth nationally and first in the South in softwood lumber production.[121] Automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Bauxite was formerly a large part of the state\'s economy, mined mostly around Saline County.[122]\nTourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname \"The Natural State\" was created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still used to this day. The state maintains 52 state parks and the National Park Service maintains seven properties in Arkansas. The completion of the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock has drawn many visitors to the city and revitalized the nearby River Market District. Many cities also hold festivals, which draw tourists to Arkansas culture, such as The Bradley County Pink Tomato Festival in Warren, King Biscuit Blues Festival, Ozark Folk Festival, Toad Suck Daze, and Tontitown Grape Festival.[citation needed]\n\nTransportation\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Several main corridors pass through Little Rock, including Interstate 30 (I-30) and I-40 (the nation\'s 3rd-busiest trucking corridor).[123] Arkansas first designated a state highway system in 1924, and first numbered its roads in 1926. Arkansas had one of the first paved roads, the Dollarway Road, and one of the first members of the Interstate Highway System. The state maintains a large system of state highways today, in addition to eight Interstates and 20 U.S. Routes.\nIn northeast Arkansas, I-55 travels north from Memphis to Missouri, with a new spur to Jonesboro (I-555). Northwest Arkansas is served by the segment of I-49 from Fort Smith to the beginning of the Bella Vista Bypass. This segment of I-49 currently follows mostly the same route as the former section of I-540 that extended north of I-40.[124] The state also has the 13th largest state highway system in the nation.[125]\n\nThe Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad\nArkansas is served by 2,750 miles (4,430 km) of railroad track divided among twenty-six railroad companies including three Class I railroads.[126] Freight railroads are concentrated in southeast Arkansas to serve the industries in the region. The Texas Eagle, an Amtrak passenger train, serves five stations in the state Walnut Ridge, Little Rock, Malvern, Arkadelphia, and Texarkana.\nArkansas also benefits from the use of its rivers for commerce. The Mississippi River and Arkansas River are both major rivers. The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the Port of Catoosa in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nThere are four airports with commercial service: Clinton National Airport (formerly Little Rock National Airport or Adams Field), Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, Fort Smith Regional Airport, and Texarkana Regional Airport, with dozens of smaller airports in the state.\nIntercity bus services across the state are provided by Flixbus, Greyhound Lines, and Jefferson Lines.[127][128]\nPublic transit and community transport services for the elderly or those with developmental disabilities are provided by agencies such as the Central Arkansas Transit Authority and the Ozark Regional Transit, organizations that are part of the Arkansas Transit Association.\n\n\n\nshowLocal transit map\n\n\nFort Smith TransitPine Bluff TransitIntracity TransitJonesboro Economical TransitTexarkana Urban Transit DistrictRock Region MetroOzark Regional TransitRazorback TransitMemphis Area Transit Authorityclass=notpageimage| Local Transit Systems (Only systems with fixed-route services are shown)\n\nGovernment\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(January 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nMain article: Politics and government of Arkansas\nAs with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer\'s term is four years long. Office holders are term-limited to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.[129]\n\nExecutive\nMain article: Governor of Arkansas\nSee also: List of governors of Arkansas and Arkansas Cabinet\nThe governor of Arkansas is Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, who was inaugurated on January 10, 2023.[130][131] The six other elected executive positions in Arkansas are lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer, auditor, and land commissioner.[132] The governor also appoints the leaders of various state boards, committees, and departments. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 election. Individuals elected to these offices are limited to a lifetime total of two four-year terms per office.\nIn Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.[133]\n\nLegislative\nMain article: Arkansas General Assembly\nThe Arkansas General Assembly is the state\'s bicameral bodies of legislators, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in \"2\", the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and are up for reelection again in two years, these \"half-terms\" do not count against a legislator\'s term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for reelection every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting.[134] Arkansas voters elected a 21â€“14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. In the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51â€“49 majority in the House of Representatives.[135]\nThe Republican Party majority status in the Arkansas State House of Representatives after the 2012 elections, is the party\'s first since 1874. Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to not have Republican control of either chamber of its house since the American Civil War.[136]\nFollowing the term limits changes, studies have shown that lobbyists have become less influential in state politics. Legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.[137]\n\nJudicial\nMain article: Courts of Arkansas\nArkansas\'s judicial branch has five court systems: Arkansas Supreme Court, Arkansas Court of Appeals, Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.\nMost cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. 25 state district court judges preside over 15 districts, with more districts created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no right of appeal from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court\'s decisions can be appealed to only the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nFederal\nBoth Arkansas\'s U.S. senators, John Boozman and Tom Cotton, are Republicans. The state has four seats in U.S. House of Representatives. All four seats are held by Republicans: Rick Crawford (1st district), French Hill (2nd district), Steve Womack (3rd district), and Bruce Westerman (4th district).[138]\n\nPolitics\nMain article: Politics and government of Arkansas\n\n\nParty registration as of May 3, 2024[139][140]\n\n\nParty\n\nTotal voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nNonpartisan\n\n1,543,863\n\n87.59%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n131,647\n\n7.47%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n86,231\n\n4.89%\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n805\n\n0.05%\n\n\nTotal\n\n1,762,546\n\n100.00%\n\nThe Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock\nArkansas governor Bill Clinton brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention endorsing Michael Dukakis. Some journalists suggested the speech was a threat to his ambitions; Clinton defined it \"a comedy of error, just one of those fluky things\".[141] He won the Democratic nomination for president in 1992. Presenting himself as a \"New Democrat\" and using incumbent George H. W. Bush\'s broken promise against him, Clinton won the 1992 presidential election with 43.0% of the vote to Bush\'s 37.5% and independent billionaire Ross Perot\'s 18.9%.\nMost Republican strength traditionally lay mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly Fort Smith and Bentonville, as well as North Central Arkansas around the Mountain Home area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90% or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.\nArkansas has elected only three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction: Tim Hutchinson, who was defeated after one term by Mark Pryor; John Boozman, who defeated incumbent Blanche Lincoln; and Tom Cotton, who defeated Pryor in 2014. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former Confederacy that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and Virginia) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.\nIn 2010, Republicans captured three of the state\'s four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2012, they won election to all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans (Rick Crawford, Army; Tim Griffin, Army Reserve; Steve Womack, Army National Guard; Tom Cotton, Army). When Pryor was defeated in 2014, the entire congressional delegation was in GOP hands for the first time since Reconstruction.\nReflecting the state\'s large evangelical population, Arkansas has a strong social conservative bent. In the aftermath of the landmark Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health Organization, Arkansas became one of nine states where abortion is banned.[142] Under the Arkansas Constitution, Arkansas is a right to work state. Its voters passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2004, with 75% voting yes,[143] although that ban has been inactive since the Supreme Court protected same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges.\nArkansas retains the death penalty. Authorized methods of execution include the electric chair.[144]\n\nMilitary\nThe Strategic Air Command facility of Little Rock Air Force Base was one of eighteen silos in the command of the 308th Strategic Missile Wing (308th SMW), specifically one of the nine silos within its 374th Strategic Missile Squadron (374th SMS). The squadron was responsible for Launch Complex 374â€“7, site of the 1980 explosion of a Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in Damascus, Arkansas.[145]\n\nTaxation\nTaxes are collected by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration.[146]\n\nHealth\nSee also: List of hospitals in Arkansas\nUAMS Medical Center, Little Rock\nAs of 2012, Arkansas, as with many Southern states, has a high incidence of premature death, infant mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and occupational fatalities compared to the rest of the United States.[147] The state is tied for 43rd with New York in percentage of adults who regularly exercise.[148] Arkansas is usually ranked as one of the least healthy states due to high obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle rates,[147] but according to a Gallup poll, Arkansas made the most immediate progress in reducing its number of uninsured residents after the Affordable Care Act passed. The percentage of uninsured in Arkansas dropped from 22.5 in 2013 to 12.4 in August 2014.[149]\nThe Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act, a statewide smoking ban excluding bars and some restaurants, went into effect in 2006.[150]\nHealthcare in Arkansas is provided by a network of hospitals as members of the Arkansas Hospital Association. Major institutions with multiple branches include Baptist Health, Community Health Systems, and HealthSouth. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock operates the UAMS Medical Center, a teaching hospital ranked as high performing nationally in cancer and nephrology.[151] The pediatric division of UAMS Medical Center is known as Arkansas Children\'s Hospital, nationally ranked in pediatric cardiology and heart surgery.[152] Together, these two institutions are the state\'s only Level I trauma centers.[153]\n\nEducation\nMain article: Education in Arkansas\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Arkansas, List of high schools in Arkansas, and List of school districts in Arkansas\nArkansas has 1,064 state-funded kindergartens, elementary, junior and senior high schools.[154]\nThe state supports a network of public universities and colleges, including two major university systems: Arkansas State University System and University of Arkansas System. The University of Arkansas, flagship campus of the University of Arkansas System in Fayetteville was ranked #63 among public schools in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.[155] Other public institutions include University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Arkansas Tech University, Henderson State University, Southern Arkansas University, and University of Central Arkansas across the state. It is also home to 11 private colleges and universities including Hendrix College, one of the nation\'s top 100 liberal arts colleges, according to U.S. News & World Report.[156]\nIn the 1920s the state required all children to attend public schools. The school year was set at 131 days, although some areas were unable to meet that requirement.[157][158]\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Arkansas, with 20,083 public school students[e] paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011â€“12 school year.[159] The rate of corporal punishment in public schools is higher only in Mississippi.[159]\n\nMedia\nThis section needs expansion.

Perhaps the best-known aspect of Arkansas\'s culture is the stereotype that its citizens are shiftless hillbillies.[161] The reputation began when early explorers characterized the state as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.[162] The most enduring icon of Arkansas\'s hillbilly reputation is The Arkansas Traveller, a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.[163] Though intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.[164] The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the Little Rock Nine adding to Arkansas\'s enduring image.[165]\nArt and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville was visited by 604,000 people in 2012, its first year.[166] The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art.[167] Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas state parks, including Historic Washington State Park, Powhatan Historic State Park, and Davidsonville Historic State Park.\nArkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the blues heritage of West Memphis, Pine Bluff, Helenaâ€“West Helena to rockabilly, bluegrass, and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the King Biscuit Blues Festival and Bikes, Blues, and BBQ pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in Mountain View is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou and A Painted House by John Grisham describe the culture at various time periods.\n\nSports and recreation\nThe flooded, forested bottomlands of east Arkansas attract wintering waterfowl.\nSports have become an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year.\nTeam sports and especially collegiate football are important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings, when the University of Arkansas first fielded a team in 1894. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to Arkansas Razorbacks football as the public image of the state.[168] Although the University of Arkansas is based in Fayetteville, the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas.\nArkansas State University became the second NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) (then known as Division I-A) team in the state in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas\'s policy of not playing intrastate games.[169] Two other campuses of the University of Arkansas System are Division I members. The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference, a league whose members all play football in the second-level Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The University of Arkansas at Little Rock, known for sports purposes as Little Rock, joined the Ohio Valley Conference in 2022 after playing in the Sun Belt Conference; unlike many other OVC members, it does not field a football program. The state\'s other Division I member is the University of Central Arkansas (UCA), which joined the ASUN Conference in 2021 after leaving the FCS Southland Conference. Because the ASUN does not plan to start FCS football competition until at least 2022, UCA football is competing in the Western Athletic Conference as part of a formal football partnership between the two leagues. Seven of Arkansas\'s smaller colleges play in NCAA Division II, with six in the Great American Conference and one in the Lone Star Conference. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in NCAA Division III, in which athletic scholarships are prohibited. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century.\nBaseball runs deep in Arkansas and was popular before the state hosted Major League Baseball (MLB) spring training in Hot Springs from 1886 to the 1920s. Two minor league teams are based in the state. The Arkansas Travelers play at Dickeyâ€“Stephens Park in North Little Rock, and the Northwest Arkansas Naturals play in Arvest Ballpark in Springdale. Both teams compete in Double-A Central.\nHunting continues in the state. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting.[170] Today a significant portion of Arkansas\'s population participates in hunting duck in the Mississippi flyway and deer across the state.[171] Ducks Unlimited has called Stuttgart, Arkansas, \"the epicenter of the duck universe\".[172] Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.[171]\nFishing has always been popular in Arkansas,[citation needed] and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of Norfork Dam, the Norfork Tailwater and the White River have become a destination for trout fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as Bull Shoals, Hot Springs Village, and Fairfield Bay have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The National Park Service has preserved the Buffalo National River in its natural state and fly fishers visit it annually.\n\nAttractions\nBlanchard Springs Caverns in Stone County\nArkansas Post National Memorial at Gillett\nBlanchard Springs Caverns\nBuffalo National River\nFort Smith National Historic Site\nHot Springs National Park\nLittle Rock Central High School National Historic Site\nPea Ridge National Military Park\nPresident William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site\nArkansas State Capitol Building\nList of Arkansas state parks\nSee also\nIndex of Arkansas-related articles\nOutline of Arkansas\nSpanish Empire\nHistory of Louisiana\nUSS Arkansas, 5 ships\n Arkansas portal\n United States portal\nNotes\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n^ The Geographic Names Index System (GNIS) of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) indicates that the official name of this feature is Magazine Mountain, not \"Mount Magazine\". Although not a hard and fast rule, generally \"Mount X\" is used for a peak and \"X Mountain\" is more frequently used for ridges, which better describes this feature. Magazine Mountain appears in the GNIS as a ridge,[3] with Signal Hill identified as its summit.[4] \"Mount Magazine\" is the name used by the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism, which follows what the locals have used since the area was first settled.\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c d e \n\nThe region was organized as the Territory of Arkansaw on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced /ËˆÉ‘ËrkÉ™nsÉ”Ë/, /É‘ËrËˆkÃ¦nzÉ™s/, and several other variants. The residents of Arkansas have called themselves either \"Arkansans\" or \"Arkansawyers\". In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1 April 105:[15]\nWhereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.\nAnd, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.\n\nBe it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is discouraged by Arkansans. Despite this, the state\'s name is still frequently mispronounced, especially by non-Americans; in fact, it is spelled in Cyrillic with the ar-KAN-zÉ™s pronunciation.\nCitizens of the state of Kansas often pronounce the Arkansas River as /É‘ËrËˆkÃ¦nzÉ™s/, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.\n\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n^ This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, regardless of whether a student was spanked multiple times in a year, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be substantially higher.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Mag\".

It borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. With over 38.9 million residents[6] across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2),[12] it is the most populous U.S. state, the third-largest U.S. state by area, and the most populated subnational entity in North America.\nThe Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas in California are the nation\'s second- and fifth-most populous urban regions respectively. Greater Los Angeles has over 18.7 million residents and the San Francisco Bay Area has over 9.6 million residents.[13] Los Angeles is the state\'s most populous city and the nation\'s second-most populous city, after New York City. San Francisco is the second-most densely populated major city in the country, after New York City. Los Angeles County is the country\'s most populous county, and San Bernardino County is the nation\'s largest county by area. Sacramento is the state\'s capital city.\nCalifornia\'s economy is the largest of any state within the United States, with a $3.6 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2022[update].[14] It is the largest sub-national economy in the world. If California were a sovereign nation, it would rank as the world\'s fifth-largest economy as of 2022[update],[15][16] just ahead of India and the United Kingdom,[17] as well as the 37th most populous.[18] The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco area are the nation\'s second- and fourth-largest urban economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.6 trillion respectively as of 2020[update]).[19] The San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation\'s highest gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas in 2018,[20] and is home to four of the world\'s ten largest companies by market capitalization[21] and four of the world\'s ten richest people.[22]\nPrior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America, and the indigenous peoples of California constituted the highest Native American population density north of what is now Mexico. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization of California by the Spanish Empire. In 1804, it was included in Alta California province within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexicanâ€“American War. The California Gold Rush started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, including the depopulation of indigenous peoples in the California genocide. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, as a free state, following the Compromise of 1850.\nNotable contributions to popular culture, ranging from entertainment, sports, music, and fashion, have their origins in California. The state also has made substantial contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, education, environmentalism, entertainment, economics, politics, technology, and religion.[23][24][25] California is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, profoundly influencing global entertainment. It is considered the origin of hippie counterculture, blue jeans, the internet, the personal computer, Barbie, skateboarding, Mission burritos, and the fortune cookie, among other inventions.[26][27][28] The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as the centers of the global technology and U.S. film industries, respectively. California\'s economy is very diverse.[29]\nCalifornia\'s agricultural industry has the highest output of any U.S. state,[30][31][32] and is led by its dairy, almonds, and grapes.[33] With the busiest port in the country (Los Angeles), California plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain, hauling in about 40% of all goods imported to the United States.[34] Slightly over 84 percent of the state\'s residents 25 or older hold a high school degree, the lowest high school education rate of all 50 states.[35] Despite a continuing exodus of businesses from Downtown San Francisco[36][37] and Downtown Los Angeles[38] since the COVID-19 pandemic, California still retains one of the largest number of Fortune 500 companies.[39]\nThe state\'s extremely diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. Two-thirds of the nation\'s earthquake risk lies in California.[40] The Central Valley, a fertile agricultural area, dominates the state\'s center. California is well known for its warm Mediterranean climate along the coast and monsoon seasonal weather inland. The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains. Droughts and wildfires are an ongoing issue for the state.[41]\n\n\nEtymology\nMain articles: Etymology of California and Island of California\nCalifornia and its namesake ruler, Queen Calafia, originate in the 1510 epic Las Sergas de EsplandiÃ¡n, written by Garci RodrÃ­guez de Montalvo.\nThe Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California (in modern-day Mexico). As Spanish explorers and settlers moved north and inland, the region known as California, or Las Californias, grew. Eventually it included lands north of the peninsula, Alta California, part of which became the present-day U.S. state of California.\nA 2017 state legislative document states, \"Numerous theories exist as to the origin and meaning of the word \'California,\'\" and that all anyone knows is the name was added to a map by 1541 \"presumably by a Spanish navigator.\"[42]\nThe name most likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of EsplandiÃ¡n by Castilian author Garci RodrÃ­guez de Montalvo.[43] This work was the fifth in a popular Spanish chivalric romance series that began with AmadÃ­s de Gaula.[44][45][46] Queen Calafia\'s kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful Black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons, as well as griffins and other strange beasts.[43][47][48] In the fictional paradise, the ruler Queen Calafia fought alongside Muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the Muslim title caliph, used for Muslim leaders.[43][49]\n\nKnow ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks. â€”â€ŠChapter CLVII of The Adventures of EsplandiÃ¡n[50]\nOfficial abbreviations of the state\'s name include CA, Cal., Calif., and US-CA.\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of California\nFurther information: History of California before 1900\nA map of indigenous Californian tribes and languages at the time of European contact\nIndigenous\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of California\nCalifornia was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America.[51] Historians generally agree that there were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization.[52] The indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests.[53]\nLiving in these diverse geographic areas, the indigenous peoples developed complex forms of ecosystem management, including forest gardening to ensure the regular availability of food and medicinal plants.[54][55] This was a form of sustainable agriculture.[56] To mitigate destructive large wildfires from ravaging the natural environment, indigenous peoples developed a practice of controlled burning.[57] This practice was recognized for its benefits by the California government in 2022.[41]\nThese groups were also diverse in their political organization, with bands, tribes, villages, and, on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage, craft specialists, and military alliances fostered social and economic relationships between many groups. Although nations would sometimes war, most armed conflicts were between groups of men for vengeance. Acquiring territory was not usually the purpose of these small-scale battles.[58]\nMen and women generally had different roles in society. Women were often responsible for weaving, harvesting, processing, and preparing food, while men for hunting and other forms of physical labor. Most societies also had roles for people whom the Spanish referred to as joyas,[59] who they saw as \"men who dressed as women\".[60] Joyas were responsible for death, burial, and mourning rituals, and they performed women\'s social roles.[60] Indigenous societies had terms such as two-spirit to refer to them. The Chumash referred to them as \'aqi.[60] The early Spanish settlers detested and sought to eliminate them.[61]\n\nBetween 1846 and 1873, U.S. government agents and private settlers perpetrated many massacres against indigenous Californians. At least 9,456 were killed with estimates as high as 100,000 deaths.[62][63]\nThe indigenous peoples saw declines in their population under Spanish, Mexican, and American rule. A major cause was Eurasian diseases to which they had not yet developed a natural immunity.[64] After California became a part of the United States, they were often forcibly removed from their lands by American settlers and de facto enslaved.[65][66][67] Many reservations to which they were moved were not sustainable.[63] Militias hired to protect settlers also perpetrated numerous massacres.[63][68] There has been significant discussion over the scale of the Native American losses and whether it should be labeled an ethnic cleansing or genocide.[69] Supporters of ethnic cleansing point out that most of the deaths resulted from diseases and settler actions.[70][71][72] Supporters of genocide point to the role of the government in initiating and enabling the atrocities. In 2019, the 40th governor of California, Gavin Newsom apologized to the indigenous peoples of California for the events.[73][72]\n\nSpanish period\nMain articles: Province of Las Californias and Spanish missions in California\nPortuguese explorer Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo claiming California for the Spanish Empire in 1542\nThe first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo in 1542. Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities; they entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island.[74] Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco. The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay.[75][76] Coincidentally the descendants of the Muslim Caliph Hasan ibn Ali in formerly Islamic Manila and had converted, then mixed Christianity with Islam, upon Spanish conquest, transited through California (Named after a Caliph) on their way to Guerrero, Mexico[77] where they played a future role in the wars of independence. SebastiÃ¡n VizcaÃ­no explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain, putting ashore in Monterey.[78] Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, RodrÃ­guez\'s idea of California as an island persisted. Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.[79]\nThe PortolÃ¡ expedition of 1769â€“70 was a pivotal event in the Spanish colonization of California, resulting in the establishment of numerous missions, presidios, and pueblos. The military and civil contingent of the expedition was led by Gaspar de PortolÃ¡, who traveled over land from Sonora into California, while the religious component was headed by JunÃ­pero Serra, who came by sea from Baja California. In 1769, PortolÃ¡ and Serra established Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡ and the Presidio of San Diego, the first religious and military settlements founded by the Spanish in California. By the end of the expedition in 1770, they would establish the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on Monterey Bay.\n\nJunÃ­pero Serra conducting the first Mass in Monterey Bay in 1770\nAfter the PortolÃ  expedition, Spanish missionaries led by Father-President Serra set out to establish 21 Spanish missions of California along El Camino Real (\"The Royal Road\") and along the California coast, 16 sites of which having been chosen during the PortolÃ¡ expedition. Numerous major cities in California grew out of missions, including San Francisco (Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s), San Diego (Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡), Ventura (Mission San Buenaventura), or Santa Barbara (Mission Santa Barbara), among others.\nJuan Bautista de Anza led a similarly important expedition throughout California in 1775â€“76, which would extend deeper into the interior and north of California. The Anza expedition selected numerous sites for missions, presidios, and pueblos, which subsequently would be established by settlers. Gabriel Moraga, a member of the expedition, would also christen many of California\'s prominent rivers with their names in 1775â€“1776, such as the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River. After the expedition, Gabriel\'s son, JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n Moraga, would found the pueblo of San Jose in 1777, making it the first civilian-established city in California.\n\nThe Spanish founded Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776, the third to be established of California\'s missions.\nDuring this same period, sailors from the Russian Empire explored along the northern coast of California. In 1812, the Russian-American Company established a trading post and small fortification at Fort Ross on the North Coast.[80][81] Fort Ross was primarily used to supply Russia\'s Alaskan colonies with food supplies. The settlement did not meet much success, failing to attract settlers or establish long term trade viability, and was abandoned by 1841.\nDuring the War of Mexican Independence, Alta California was largely unaffected and uninvolved in the revolution,[82] though many Californios supported independence from Spain, which many believed had neglected California and limited its development.[83] Spain\'s trade monopoly on California had limited local trade prospects. Following Mexican independence, California ports were freely able to trade with foreign merchants. Governor Pablo Vicente de SolÃ¡ presided over the transition from Spanish colonial rule to independent Mexican rule.\n\nMexican period\nMain articles: Alta California and Ranchos of California\nThe flag used by Californio leader Juan Bautista Alvarado\'s 1836 California independence movement\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic. The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.[84] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants. Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 California Gold Rush.\nFrom the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California. The early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both internal and with the central Mexican government.[85] During this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to secure the governorship during 1836â€“1842.[86] The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state, and had been aided by Anglo-American residents of California,[87] including Isaac Graham.[88] In 1840, one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested, leading to the Graham Affair, which was resolved in part with the intercession of Royal Navy officials.[87]\n\nGeneral Mariano G. Vallejo reviewing his troops in the Sonoma Plaza, 1846\nOne of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as \"Marsh\'s route\". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.[89] He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.[90]\nAfter ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much-hated Mexican general, Manuel Micheltorena and the California governor he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The armies of each met at the Battle of Providencia near Los Angeles. Marsh had been forced against his will to join Micheltorena\'s army. Ignoring his superiors, during the battle, he signaled the other side for a parley. There were many settlers from the United States fighting on both sides. He convinced each side that they had no reason to be fighting each other. As a result of Marsh\'s actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship. This paved the way to California\'s ultimate acquisition by the United States.[91][92][93][94][95]\n\nU.S. Conquest and the California Republic\nMain articles: Conquest of California and Bear Flag Revolt\nThe 1846 Bear Flag Revolt declared the California Republic and prefaced the American conquest of California.\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \"California Republic\") at Sonoma. The Republic\'s only president was William B. Ide,[96] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.\nThe California Republic was short-lived;[97] the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexicanâ€“American War (1846â€“1848).[98]\nCommodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay in 1846 and began the U.S. military invasion of California, with Northern California capitulating in less than a month to the United States forces.[99] In Southern California, Californios continued to resist American forces. Notable military engagements of the conquest include the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Dominguez Rancho in Southern California, as well as the Battle of OlÃ³mpali and the Battle of Santa Clara in Northern California. After a series of defensive battles in the south, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing a censure and establishing de facto American control in California.[100]\n\nEarly American period\nSee also: California Gold Rush and Interim government of California\nMap of California and Nevada by SB Linton, 1876\nThe Treaty of Cahuenga, signed in 1847 by Californio AndrÃ©s Pico and American John C. FrÃ©mont, was a ceasefire that ended the U.S. Conquest of California.\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.[101]\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state\'s demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Middle Easterns, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. By the time of California\'s application for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000. By 1854, more than 300,000 settlers had come.[102] Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.[103]\n\nCalifornia Gold RushAn ad to sail to California, c.â€‰1850San Francisco harbor, c.â€‰1850â€“51Mining near Sacramento, c.â€‰1852\nThe seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in Monterey from 1777 until 1845.[84] Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of Alta California, had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey, under consul Thomas O. Larkin.\nIn 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850â€“1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852â€“1853), and nearby Benicia (1853â€“1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854[104] with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento.\nOnce the state\'s Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to statehood. On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California became a free state and September 9 a state holiday.\nDuring the American Civil War (1861â€“1865), California sent gold shipments eastward to Washington in support of the Union.[105] However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army, such as the \"California 100 Company\", were unofficially associated with the state of California due to a majority of their members being from California.\nAt the time of California\'s admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years later, and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln, the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869. California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week\'s time. Much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state\'s prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere. In the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work.[106] Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.[107]\n\n1900â€“present\nMain article: History of California 1900â€“present\nView of the destruction from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake\nIn the twentieth century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to the US and California specifically to attempt to purchase and own land in the state. However, the state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land.[108] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps such as at Tule Lake and Manzanar.[109] In 2020, California officially apologized for this internment.[110]\nMigration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California\'s population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.[111]\nTo meet the population\'s needs, major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts; the Oroville and Shasta Dams; and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hollywood studios, like Paramount Pictures, helped transform Hollywood into the world capital of film and helped solidify Los Angeles as a global economic hub.\nMeanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state\'s wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking third (behind New York and Michigan) among the 48 states.[112] California however easily ranked first in production of military ships during the war (transport, cargo, [merchant ships] such as Liberty ships, Victory ships, and warships) at drydock facilities in San Diego, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[113][114][115][116] Due to the hiring opportunities California offered during the conflict, the population of the state greatly multiplied from the immigration it received due to the work offered in its war factories, military bases, and training facilities.[117] After World War II, California\'s economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries,[118] whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War.[118][119] Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley.[120] As a result of these efforts, California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the United States center of agricultural production.[121] Just before the Dot Com Bust, California had the fifth-largest economy in the world among nations.[122]\nIn the mid and late twentieth century, a number of race-related incidents occurred in the state. Tensions between police and African Americans, combined with unemployment and poverty in inner cities, led to violent riots, such as the 1965 Watts riots and 1992 Rodney King riots.[123][124] California was also the hub of the Black Panther Party, a group known for arming African Americans to defend against racial injustice [125] and for organizing free breakfast programs for schoolchildren.[126] Additionally, Mexican, Filipino, and other migrant farm workers rallied in the state around Cesar Chavez for better pay in the 1960s and 1970s.[127]\n\nCivil rights activist Cesar Chavez, flanked by Brown Berets, at a 1971 rally during the Chicano movement\nDuring the 20th century, two great disasters happened in California. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U.S. history.[128]\nAlthough air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze known as \"smog\" has been substantially abated after the passage of federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.[129][130]\nAn energy crisis in 2001 led to rolling blackouts, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company came under heavy criticism.[131]\nHousing prices in urban areas continued to increase; a modest home which in the 1960s cost $25,000 would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007â€“8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.[132][133]\n\nThe 2007 launch of the iPhone by Apple founder Steve Jobs in Silicon Valley, the largest tech hub in the world\nIn the twenty-first century, droughts and frequent wildfires attributed to climate change have occurred in the state.[134][135] From 2011 to 2017, a persistent drought was the worst in its recorded history.[136] The 2018 wildfire season was the state\'s deadliest and most destructive, most notably Camp Fire.[137]\nOne of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred in California was first of which was confirmed on January 26, 2020.[138][139] Meaning, all of the early confirmed cases were persons who had recently travelled to China in Asia, as testing was restricted to this group. On this January 29, 2020, as disease containment protocols were still being developed, the U.S. Department of State evacuated 195 persons from Wuhan, China aboard a chartered flight to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, and in this process, it may have granted and conferred to escalated within the land and the US at cosmic.[140][141] On February 5, 2020, the U.S. evacuated 345 more citizens from Hubei Province to two military bases in California, Travis Air Force Base in Solano County and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, San Diego, where they were quarantined for 14 days.[140][142] A state of emergency was largely declared in this state of the nation on March 4, 2020, and remained in effect until Governor Gavin Newsom ended it on February 28, 2023.[143] A mandatory statewide stay-at-home order was issued on March 19, 2020, due to increase, which was ended on January 25, 2021, allowing citizens to return to normal life.[144] On April 6, 2021, the state announced plans to fully reopen the economy by June 15, 2021.[145]\nCultural and language revitalization efforts among indigenous Californians have progressed among several tribes as of 2022.[146][147] Some land returns to indigenous stewardship have occurred throughout California.[148][149][150] In 2022, the largest dam removal and river restoration project in US history was announced for the Klamath River as a win for California tribes.[151][152]\n\nGeography\nMain article: Geography of California\nFurther information: Northern California and Southern California\nTopographic map of California\nCovering an area of 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km2), California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas.[153] California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the ten southernmost counties,[154][155] and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties.[156][157] It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur).\nIn the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California\'s productive agricultural heartland.\nDivided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports.\n\nBig Sur, on the Central Coast\nYosemite, in the Sierra Nevada\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state\'s population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\nSuisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the Carquinez Strait, which flows into San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San Francisco Bay, which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait.\nThe Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast, while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco.\nThe Sierra Nevada (Spanish for \"snowy range\") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m).[3][4][note 1] The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume.\nTo the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States.\n\nDeath Valley, in the Mojave Desert\nSan Miguel, in the Channel Islands\nThe Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. A remnant of Pleistocene-era Lake Corcoran, Tulare Lake dried up by the early 20th century after its tributary rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses.[158]\nAbout 45 percent of the state\'s total surface area is covered by forests,[159] and California\'s diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old.[160][161]\nIn the south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the Badwater Basin at âˆ’279 feet (âˆ’85 m).[5] The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.\nA majority of California\'s cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California; or the Los Angeles area, the Inland Empire, or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast.\nAs part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, and landslides on steep terrain; California also has several volcanoes. It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state, the largest being the San Andreas Fault. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year; most are too small to be felt,[162] but two-thirds of the human risk from earthquakes lies in California.[40]\n\nClimate\nMain article: Climate of California\nFurther information: Climate change in California\nKÃ¶ppen climate types in California\nMost of the state has a Mediterranean climate. The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast. The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean.[163][164][165]\n\nCalifornia wildfires affect the state yearly. In the south, the Santa Ana winds often expand fires and spread smoke over hundreds of miles.\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California\'s mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Coastal northwestern California has a temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\nCalifornia\'s mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side, creating extensive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,[166][167] 134 Â°F (56.7 Â°C), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was âˆ’45 Â°F (âˆ’43 Â°C) on January 20, 1937, in Boca.[168]\nThe table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a selection of places throughout the state; some highly populated and some not. This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka, the extreme heat of Death Valley, and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n\nAverage temperatures and precipitation for selected communities in California[169]\n\n\nLocation\n\nAugust(Â°F)\n\nAugust(Â°C)\n\nJanuary(Â°F)\n\nJanuary(Â°C)\n\nAnnualprecipitation(mm/in)\n\n\nLos Angeles\n83/64\n29/18\n66/48\n20/8\n377/15\n\n\nLAX/LA Beaches\n75/64\n23/18\n65/49\n18/9\n326/13\n\n\nSan Diego\n76/67\n24/19\n65/49\n18/9\n262/10\n\n\nSan Jose\n82/58\n27/14\n58/42\n14/5\n401/16\n\n\nSan Francisco\n67/54\n20/12\n56/46\n14/8\n538/21\n\n\nFresno\n97/66\n34/19\n55/38\n12/3\n292/11\n\n\nSacramento\n91/58\n33/14\n54/39\n12/3\n469/18\n\n\nOakland\n73/58\n23/14\n58/44\n14/7\n588/23\n\n\nBakersfield\n96/69\n36/21\n56/39\n13/3\n165/7\n\n\nRiverside\n94/60\n35/18\n67/39\n19/4\n260/10\n\n\nEureka\n62/53\n16/11\n54/41\n12/5\n960/38\n\n\nDeath Valley\n115/86\n46/30\n67/40\n19/4\n60/2\n\n\nMammoth Lakes\n77/45\n25/7\n40/15\n4/ âˆ’9\n583/23\n\nThe wide range of climates leads to a high demand for water. Over time, droughts have been increasing due to climate change and overextraction,[170] becoming less seasonal and more year-round, further straining California\'s electricity supply[171] and water security[172][173] and having an impact on California business, industry, and agriculture.[174]\nIn 2022, a new state program was created in collaboration with indigenous peoples of California to revive the practice of controlled burns as a way of clearing excessive forest debris and making landscapes more resilient to wildfires. Native American use of fire in ecosystem management was outlawed in 1911, yet has now been recognized.[41]\n\nEcology\nMain articles: Ecology of California and Environment of California\nMount Whitney, in the Sierra Nevada, is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States.\nCalifornia is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.[175]\nCalifornia\'s large number of endemic species includes relict species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (Ceanothus). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat.\n\nFlora and fauna\nMain articles: Fauna of California and California Floristic Province\nSee also: List of California native plants\nGiant Sequoias, native to California, are the largest trees in the world. Shown is the Grizzly Giant in Yosemite.\nCalifornia boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California\'s native grasses are perennial plants,[176] and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state.[citation needed] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California\'s hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.[177]\nBecause California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran Desert; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state\'s highest elevations.[178]\nPlant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. Nemophila, mint, Phacelia, Viola, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica, the state flower) also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.[178]\n\nA California sea lion in La Jolla\nThe transition zone includes most of California\'s forests with the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the \"big tree\" or giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). Tanbark oak, California laurel, sugar pine, madrona, broad-leaved maple, and Douglas-fir also grow here. Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, tulip, and tiger and leopard lilies.[179]\nThe high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus; the unique Sierra puffball is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500 feet (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including Sierra primrose, yellow columbine, alpine buttercup, and alpine shooting star.[178][180]\nPalm trees are a well-known feature of California, particularly in Southern California and Los Angeles; many species have been imported, though the Washington filifera (commonly known as the California fan palm) is native to the state, mainly growing in the Colorado Desert oases.[181] Other common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and Scotch broom. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird\'s beak, McDonald\'s rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. As of December 1997[update], 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.[178]\n\nA Tule Elk in the San Joaquin Valley\nIn the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area\'s reptilian life include the sidewinder viper, desert tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.[178][182][183][184]\nIn the transition zone, there are Colombian black-tailed deer, black bears, gray foxes, cougars, bobcats, and Roosevelt elk. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too. Birds such as the kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird thrive here as well.[178][185]\nThe Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, mountain chickadee, hermit thrush, American dipper, and Townsend\'s solitaire. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the gray-crowned rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as Anna\'s hummingbird and Clark\'s nutcracker. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, white-tailed jackrabbit, and the bighorn sheep. As of April 2003[update], the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer, coyote, mountain lion, northern flicker, and several species of hawk and sparrow.[178]\n\nMethuselah is the oldest tree in the world, found in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of Inyo National Forest.\nAquatic life in California thrives, from the state\'s mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them rainbow, golden, and cutthroat. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include sea bass, yellowfin tuna, barracuda, and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.[178]\nAs of April 2003[update], 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox, Point Arena mountain beaver, Pacific pocket mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse, Morro Bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat), Amargosa vole, California least tern, California condor, loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow, San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered[186] and two that are threatened are on the federal list.[187][188] Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher, Paiute cutthroat trout, southern sea otter, and northern spotted owl. California has a total of 290,821 acres (1,176.91 km2) of National Wildlife Refuges.[178] As of September 2010[update], 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list.[189] Also, as of the same year[update], 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list.[189]\n\nRivers\nMain article: List of rivers of California\nSan Francisco Bay (center left) and the California Delta (top right)\nThe most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley. The two rivers join in the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin system, including the Pit River, Feather River and Tuolumne River.\nThe Klamath and Trinity Rivers drain a large area in far northwestern California. The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. The Colorado River forms the state\'s southeast border with Arizona.\nMost of California\'s major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the California State Water Project diverting water from Northern to Southern California. The state\'s coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission.\n\nRegions\nMain article: List of regions of California\nSee also: List of places in California\nMap of California\'s regions\nMap showing the division between Northern California (top white) and Southern California (bottom red)\nCalifornia is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties. Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.\n\nMajor divisions\nNorthern California\nSouthern California\nRegions\n\nShasta Cascade\nKlamath Basin\nModoc Plateau\nNorth Coast\nLost Coast\nBay Area\nNorth Bay\nSan Francisco Peninsula\nSouth Bay (Santa Clara Valley)\nEast Bay\nCentral Valley\nSacramento Valley\nGreater Sacramento\nSan Joaquin Valley\nMetropolitan Fresno\nCalifornia Delta\nSierra Nevada\nGold Country\nEastern Sierra\nCentral Coast\nMonterey Bay Area\nBig Sur\nGaviota Coast\nSouthern California\nGreater Los Angeles\nAntelope Valley\nLos Angeles Basin\nSan Fernando Valley\nSan Gabriel Valley\nSanta Clarita Valley\nChannel Islands\nOrange Coast\nInland Empire\nSan Diegoâ€“Tijuana\nCalifornia Deserts\nMojave Desert\nGreat Basin Desert\nColorado Desert (Sonoran Desert)\nCalexicoâ€“Mexicali\nCities and towns\nSee also: List of cities and towns in California and List of largest California cities by population\nThe state has 482 incorporated cities and towns, of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\".[190]\nSacramento became California\'s first incorporated city on February 27, 1850.[191] San Jose, San Diego, and Benicia tied for California\'s second incorporated city, each receiving incorporation on March 27, 1850.[192][193][194] Jurupa Valley became the state\'s most recent and 482nd incorporated municipality, on July 1, 2011.[195][196]\nThe majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas: the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Riverside-San Bernardino Area, the San Diego metropolitan area, or the Sacramento

California in 1850 was close to 150,000before declining to 15,000 by 1900.[202]\n\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents lives in California.[203][204] The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census.[201] During that decade, the state\'s population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation, resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives, the first loss in its entire history.[203] The estimated state population in 2023 was 38.94 million.[204] For well over a century (1900â€“2020), California experienced steady population growth. Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940â€“2020.[205][206][207] Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California.[203][208] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state[209] with emigrants listing high cost of living,[210] high taxes,[211][212] and a difficult business environment as the motivation.[212] The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000.[203]\nThe California Department of Finance issued stark revision to its population projections through 2060 down to 39.51 million, a figure 4.7 million lower than projection it had issued only two years earlier. The magnitude of the revision exceeds Los Angeles\'s population.[213]\n\nCalifornia\'s population density, 2020\nThe Greater Los Angeles Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States (U.S.), while Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the U.S. Conversely, San Francisco is the most densely-populated city in California and one of the most densely populated cities in the U.S.. Also, Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous U.S. county for decades, and it alone is more populous than 42 U.S. states.[214][215] Including Los Angeles, four of the top 20 most populous cities in the U.S. are in California: Los Angeles (2nd), San Diego (8th), San Jose (10th), and San Francisco (17th). The center of population of California is located four miles west-southwest of the city of Shafter, Kern County.[note 3]\nAs of 2019, California ranked second among states by life expectancy, with a life expectancy of 80.9 years.[217]\nStarting in the year 2010, for the first time since the California Gold Rush, California-born residents made up the majority of the state\'s population.[218] Along with the rest of the United States, California\'s immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s to early 2010s.[219] Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia.[220] In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. Fifty-seven percent came from Asian countries versus 22% from Latin American countries.[220] Net immigration from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants, has dropped to zero / less than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating.[219]\nThe state\'s population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers.[221] The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011.[222] Despite these recent trends, illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state\'s population, the third highest percentage of any state in the country,[223][note 4] totaling nearly 2.6 million.[224] In particular, illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in Los Angeles, Monterey, San Benito, Imperial, and Napa Countiesâ€”the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor.[225] More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico.[224] The state of California and some California cities, including Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco,[226] have adopted sanctuary policies.[227]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 171,521 homeless people in California.[228][229]\n\nRace and ethnicity\nHispanic and Latino Californians make up the state\'s largest ethnic group.

Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in California.[231] Non-Hispanic whites constituted 36.8% of the state\'s population.[231] Californios are the Hispanic residents native to California, who make up the Spanish-speaking community that has existed in California since 1542, of varying Mexican American/Chicano, Criollo Spaniard, and Mestizo origin.[232] California has the largest Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan population.[233]\nAs of 2011[update], 75.1% of California\'s population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).[234]\nIn terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California\'s Asian American population is estimated at 4.4 million, constituting a third of the nation\'s total. California\'s Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.[235]\nAccording to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population.[236] Over the past 25 years, the population of non-Hispanic whites has declined, while Hispanic and Asian populations have grown. Between 1970 and 2011, non-Hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state\'s population to 40%, while Hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011.[237] It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration.[238] With the decline of immigration from Latin America, Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in California; this growth is primarily driven by immigration from China, India and the Philippines, respectively.[239]\nMost of California\'s immigrant population are born in Mexico (3.9 million), the Philippines (825,200), China (768,400), India (556,500) and Vietnam (502,600).[240]\nCalifornia has the largest multiracial population in the United States.[241] California has the highest rate of interracial marriage.[242]\nBy the year 1880, the most of California\'s immigrants came from Ireland, China, New York, Germany and England.[243]\nMexican is the most common ancestry in California, followed by English, German and Irish.[244]\n\nLanguages\nMain article: Languages of California\nSee also: California English and Spanish language in California\n\nLanguages spoken in California by more than 100,000 persons\nhide\n\nLanguage\nPopulation(as of 2021[update])[245]\n%\n\n\nEnglish\n\n20,763,638\n\n56.08%\n\n\nSpanish\n\n10,434,308\n\n28.18%\n\n\nChinese\n\n1,244,445\n\n3.36%\n\n\nTagalog\n\n757,488\n\n2.05%\n\n\nVietnamese\n\n544,046\n\n1.47%\n\n\nKorean\n\n356,901\n\n0.96%\n\n\nArabic\n\n231,612\n\n0.63%\n\n\nPersian\n\n221,650\n\n0.6%\n\n\nArmenian\n\n211,614\n\n0.57%\n\n\nHindi\n\n208,148\n\n0.56%\n\n\nRussian\n\n178,176\n\n0.48%\n\n\nPunjabi\n\n156,763\n\n0.42%\n\n\nJapanese\n\n135,992\n\n0.37%\n\n\nFrench\n\n126,371\n\n0.34%\n\nEnglish serves as California\'s de jure and de facto official language. According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home. 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups.[245] Like most U.S. states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986. Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences.[246][247][248]\n\nThe Constitution of California was written in both English (left) and Spanish (right) by both American and Californio delegates.\nSpanish is the most commonly spoken language in California, behind English, spoken by 28.18% (10,434,308) of the population (in 2021).[245] The Spanish language has been spoken in California since 1542 and is deeply intertwined with California\'s cultural landscape and history.[249][250][251] Spanish was the official administrative language of California through the Spanish and Mexican eras, until 1848. Following the U.S. Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the U.S. Government guaranteed the rights of Spanish speaking Californians. The first Constitution of California was written in both languages at the Monterey Constitutional Convention of 1849 and protected the rights of Spanish speakers to use their language in government proceedings and mandating that all government documents be published in both English and Spanish.[252]\nDespite the initial recognition of Spanish by early American governments in California, the revised 1879 constitution stripped the rights of Spanish speakers and the official status of Spanish.[253] The growth of the English-only movement by the mid-20th century led to the passage of 1986 California Proposition 63, which enshrined English as the only official language in California and ended Spanish language instruction in schools.[254] 2016 California Proposition 58 reversed the prohibition on bilingual education, though there are still many barriers to the proliferation of Spanish bilingual education, including a shortage of teachers and lack of funding.[255][254][256] The government of California has since made efforts to promote Spanish language access and bilingual education,[257][258] as have private educational institutions in California.[259] Many businesses in California promote the usage of Spanish by their employees, to better serve both California\'s Hispanic population and the larger Spanish-speaking world.[260][261]\nCalifornia has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in six language families.[262][263] A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages among California farmworkers.[264] All of California\'s indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.[note 6] California has the highest concentration nationwide of Chinese, Vietnamese and Punjabi speakers.\nAs a result of the state\'s increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken American English in California since the late 20th century. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of American English used in other regions of the United States.[265]\n\nReligion\nMain article: Religion in California\nSee also: List of cathedrals in California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute\'s 2021 American Values Survey[266]\n\n  Catholicism (34%)  Protestantism (27%)  Jehovah\'s Witness (1%)  Mormonism (1%)  Unaffiliated (28%)  Buddhism (2%)  Judaism (1%)  Hinduism (1%)  Other (5%)\n\n\nThe largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California\'s population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[267] This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions in 2008 was 0.5% Muslim, 1% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[268] The American Jewish Year Book placed the total Jewish population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006.[269] According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest denominations by adherents in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 10,233,334; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 763,818; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 489,953.[270]\n\nThe Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, built 1791â€“94, is the oldest parish in California.[271]\nThe first priests to come to California were Catholic missionaries from Spain. Catholics founded 21 missions along the California coast, as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the states: 62 percent of Californians say they are \"absolutely certain\" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.[272]\n\nCulture\nMain article: Culture of California\nSee also: Cuisine of California\nThe Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.[273]\nCalifornia has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as the Beach Boys promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.\nThe California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California\'s economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.\n\nMedia and entertainment\nFurther information: Media in Los Angeles, Media in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Music in California\nSee also: List of amusement parks in the Americas Â§ California, List of newspapers in California, and List of radio stations in California\nDisney, headquartered in Burbank, is one of the world\'s largest media and entertainment companies.\nHollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S. film industry\'s \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area. Many animation studios are also headquartered in the state.\nThe four major American television commercial broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) as well as other networks all have production facilities and offices in the state. All the four major commercial broadcast networks, plus the two major Spanish-language networks (Telemundo and Univision) each have at least three owned-and-operated TV stations in California, including at least one in Los Angeles and at least one in San Francisco.[note 7]\n\nTwitter, headquartered in San Francisco, is one of the largest social media networks in the world.\nThe California State Fair is held annually during the summer at Cal Expo in northeastern Sacramento.\nOne of the oldest radio stations in the United States still in existence, KCBS (AM) in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded in 1909. Universal Music Group, one of the \"Big Four\" record labels, is based in Santa Monica, while Warner Records is based in Los Angeles. Many independent record labels, such as Mind of a Genius Records, are also headquartered in the state. California is also the birthplace of several international music genres, including the Bakersfield sound, Bay Area thrash metal, alternative rock, g-funk, nu metal, glam metal, thrash metal, psychedelic rock, stoner rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, metalcore, pop punk, surf music, third wave ska, west coast hip hop, west coast jazz, jazz rap, and many other genres. Other genres such as pop rock, indie rock, hard rock, hip hop, pop, rock, rockabilly, country, heavy metal, grunge, new wave and disco were popularized in the state. In addition, many British bands, such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and the Rolling Stones settled in the state after becoming internationally famous.\nAs the home of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area is the headquarters of several prominent internet media, social media, and other technology companies. Three of the \"Big Five\" technology companies (Apple, Meta, and Google) are based in the area as well as other services such as Netflix, Pandora Radio, Twitter, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Other prominent companies that are headquartered here include HP inc. and Intel. Microsoft and Amazon also have offices in the area.\nCalifornia, particularly Southern California,[274] is considered the birthplace of modern car culture.[275]\nSeveral fast food, fast casual, and casual dining chains were also founded California, including some that have since expanded internationally like California Pizza Kitchen, Denny\'s, IHOP, McDonald\'s, Panda Express, and Taco Bell.\n\nSports\nMain article: Sports in California\nSee also: List of professional sports teams in California\nPebble Beach Golf Links, one of the best ranked golf courses in the world\nThe Grand Prix of Long Beach is the longest running major street race in North America.\nCalifornia has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises. San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team. The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 12 times at five different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, Levi\'s Stadium, and San Diego\'s Qualcomm Stadium. A thirteenth, Super Bowl LVI, was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on February 13, 2022.[276]\nCalifornia has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual Rose Bowl, among others.\nThe NFL has three teams in the state: the Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, and San Francisco 49ers.\nMLB has five teams in the state: the San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels, and San Diego Padres.[277]\nThe NBA has four teams in the state: the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings.

The 1932 and 1984 summer games were held in Los Angeles. Squaw Valley Ski Resort (now Palisades Tahoe) in the Lake Tahoe region hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, marking the fourth time that California will have hosted the Olympic Games.[278] Multiple games during the 1994 FIFA World Cup took place in California, with the Rose Bowl hosting eight matches (including the final), while Stanford Stadium hosted six matches.\nIn addition to the Olympic games, California also hosts the California State Games.\nMany sports, such as surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding, were invented in California, while others like volleyball, beach soccer, and skiing were popularized in the state.\nOther sports that are big in the state include golf, rodeo, tennis, mountain climbing, marathon running, horse racing, bowling, mixed martial arts, boxing, and motorsports, especially NASCAR and Formula One.\n\nLos Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028.\n\n\nTeam\n\nSport\n\nLeague\n\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nAmerican football\n\nNational Football League (NFL)\n\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nAmerican football\n\nNational Football League\n\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nAmerican football\n\nNational Football League\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB)\n\n\nLos Angeles Angels\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\n\nOakland Athletics\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\n\nSan Francisco Giants\n\nBaseball\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nBasketball\n\nNational Basketball Association (NBA)\n\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nBasketball\n\nNational Basketball Association\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nBasketball\n\nNational Basketball Association\n\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nBasketball\n\nNational Basketball Association\n\n\nLos Angeles Sparks\n\nBasketball\n\nWomen\'s National Basketball Association (WNBA)\n\n\nAnaheim Ducks\n\nIce hockey\n\nNational Hockey League (NHL)\n\n\nLos Angeles Kings\n\nIce hockey\n\nNational Hockey League\n\n\nSan Jose Sharks\n\nIce hockey\n\nNational Hockey League\n\n\nLos Angeles Galaxy\n\nSoccer\n\nMajor League Soccer (MLS)\n\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes\n\nSoccer\n\nMajor League Soccer\n\n\nLos Angeles Football Club\n\nSoccer\n\nMajor League Soccer\n\n\nAngel City FC\n\nSoccer\n\nNational Women\'s Soccer League (NWSL)\n\n\nSan Diego Wave FC\n\nSoccer\n\nNational Women\'s Soccer League\n\n\nSan Diego Legion\n\nRugby union\n\nMajor League Rugby\n\nEducation\nMain article: Education in California\nSee also: Spanish bilingual education in California\nSanta Barbara High School, one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in Southern California\nCalifornia has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million in the 2005â€“06 school year, giving California more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country.[279]\nPublic secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California\'s public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades Kâ€“12 and community colleges that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.[280]\nIn 2016, California\'s Kâ€“12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 per student vs. $11,800 for the U.S. average).[281]\nFor 2012, California\'s Kâ€“12 public schools ranked 48th in the number of employees per student, at 0.102 (the U.S. average was 0.137), while paying the 7th most per employee, $49,000 (the U.S. average was $39,000).[282][283][284]\n\nHigher education\nMain article: List of colleges and universities in California\nUC Berkeley is the oldest campus of the University of California, and the state\'s flagship public university.\nStanford University is a private university that is one of the top-ranked universities in the world.[285]\nCalifornia public postsecondary education is organized into three separate systems:\n\nThe state\'s public research university system is the University of California (UC). As of fall 2011, the University of California had a combined student body of 234,464 students.[286] There are ten UC campuses; nine are general campuses offering both undergraduate and graduate programs which culminate in the award of bachelor\'s degrees, master\'s degrees, and doctorates; there is one specialized campus, UC San Francisco, which is entirely dedicated to graduate education in health care, and is home to the UCSF Medical Center, the highest-ranked hospital in California.[287] The system was originally intended to accept the top one-eighth of California high school students, but several of the campuses have become even more selective.[288][289][290] The UC system historically held exclusive authority to award the doctorate, but this has since changed and CSU now has limited statutory authorization to award a handful of types of doctoral degrees independently of UC.\nThe California State University (CSU) system has almost 430,000 students. The CSU (which takes the definite article in its abbreviated form, while UC does not) was originally intended to accept the top one-third of California high school students, but several of the campuses have become much more selective.[290][291] The CSU was originally authorized to award only bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees, and could award the doctorate only as part of joint programs with UC or private universities. Since then, CSU has been granted the authority to independently award several doctoral degrees (in specific academic fields that do not intrude upon UC\'s traditional jurisdiction).\nThe California Community Colleges system provides lower-division coursework culminating in the associate degree, as well as basic skills and workforce training culminating in various kinds of certificates. (Fifteen California community colleges now award four-year bachelor\'s degrees in disciplines which are in high demand in their geographical area.[292]) It is the largest network of higher education in the U.S., composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6 million.\nCalifornia is also home to notable private universities such as Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of Southern California, the Claremont Colleges, Santa Clara University, Loyola Marymount University, the University of San Diego, the University of San Francisco, Chapman University, Pepperdine University, Occidental College, and University of the Pacific, among numerous other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions. California has a particularly high density of arts colleges, including the California College of the Arts, California Institute of the Arts, San Francisco Art Institute, Art Center College of Design, and Academy of Art University, among others.\n\nEconomy\nMain article: Economy of California\nSilicon Valley is the largest tech hub in the world and home to Big Tech companies like Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Intel, Netflix, Inc., Uber, Nvidia, HP, X Corp and many more.\nCalifornia\'s economy ranks among the largest in the world. As of 2022[update], the gross state product (GSP) was $3.6 trillion ($92,190 per capita), the largest in the United States.[14] California is responsible for one seventh of the nation\'s gross domestic product (GDP).[293] As of 2018[update], California\'s nominal GDP is larger than all but four countries (the United States, China, Japan, and Germany).[294] In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP),[295] it is larger than all but eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia).[296] California\'s economy is larger than Africa and Australia and is almost as large as South America.[297] The state recorded total, non-farm employment of 16,677,800[298] as of September 2021[update] among 966,224 employer establishments.[299]\n\nThe combined Port of Los Angeles-Port of Long Beach is the largest port in the U.S. by import volume and one of the busiest ports in the world.\nAs the largest and second-largest U.S. ports respectively, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in Southern California collectively play a pivotal role in the global supply chain, together hauling in about 40% of all imports to the United States by TEU volume.[34] The Port of Oakland and Port of Hueneme are the 10th and 26th largest seaports in the U.S., respectively, by number of TEUs handled.[300]\nThe five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.[301] California has an unemployment rate of 3.9% as of September 2022[update].[298]\nCalifornia\'s economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state\'s economy. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006.[302]\nComputers and electronic products are California\'s top export, accounting for 42 percent of all the state\'s exports in 2008.[302]\n\nAgriculture\nMain article: Agriculture in California\nFurther information: Strawberry cultivation in California, Production of peaches in California, and Walnuts in California\nSee also: California nut crimes\nCalifornia vineyards in Wine Country. The agricultural industry in California is the largest in the U.S.\nAgriculture is an important sector in California\'s economy. According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes.[33] Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004.[303] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production.[303] In 2008, California\'s 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue.[304] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue.[305] The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state\'s GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce.[306]\n\nIncome\nSee also: California locations by per capita income\nCalifornia is the most visited state in the country.[307] Disneyland in Anaheim is a major tourist destination, with 16.9 million annual visits in 2022.[308]\nPer capita GDP in 2007 was $38,956, ranking eleventh in the nation.[309] Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession. The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage. According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia.[310]\nUsing the supplemental poverty measure, California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country.[311] However, using the official measure the poverty rate was only 13.3% as of 2017.[312] Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. The high-technology sectors in Northern California, specifically Silicon Valley, in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, have emerged from the economic downturn caused by the dot-com bust.\nIn 2019, there were 1,042,027 millionaire households in the state, more than any other state in the nation.[313] In 2010, California residents were ranked first among the states with the best average credit score of 754.[314]\n\n\n\n\nIf California was an independent country, its gross domestic product (nominal) would rank fifth in the world (2022).[315]\n\n\n\nCalifornia counties by GDP (2021)[316]\n\n\nState finances\nMain articles: California state finances and 2008â€“12 California budget crisis\nCalifornia economic regions\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011.[317][318] California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion.[319] In January 2011, California\'s total debt was at least $265 billion.[320] On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state\'s debt remains at $132 billion.[321][322]\nWith the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012 and Proposition 55 in 2016, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal income tax rate with ten tax brackets, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum state sales tax of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.[323]\nAll real property is taxable annually; the ad valorem tax is based on the property\'s fair market value at the time of purchase or the value of new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per Proposition 13.\n\nInfrastructure\nEnergy\nMain article: Energy in California\nFurther information: Solar power in California and Wind power in California\nSee also: History of oil in California through 1930 and Plug-in electric vehicles in California\nMoss Landing Power Plant, located on the coast of Monterey Bay\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country\'s largest users of energy. The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state. Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States.[324] Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46.[325]\nThe state\'s crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation.\n\nIvanpah Solar Power Facility, located in the Mojave Desert\nAs a result of the state\'s strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States. Senate Bill SB 1020 (the Clean Energy, Jobs and Affordability Act of 2022) commits the state to running its operations on clean, renewable energy resources by 2035, and SB 1203 also requires the state to achieve net-zero operations for all agencies. Currently, several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert. California\'s wind farms include Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. The Tehachapi area is also where the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project is located.[326] Several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power. It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050.[327]\nCalifornia has one major nuclear power plant (Diablo Canyon) in operation. The San Onofre nuclear plant was shut down in 2013. More than 1,700 tons of radioactive waste are stored at San Onofre,[328] and sit on the coast where there is a record of past tsunamis.[329] Voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal.[330][note 8] In addition, several cities such as Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclear-free zones.\n\nTransportation\nMain article: Transportation in California\nSee also: History of rail transportation in California\nThe Golden Gate Bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area, is one of the most famous bridges in the world.\nHighways\nCalifornia\'s vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways (\'freeways\'), limited-access roads (\'expressways\'), and highways. California is known for its car culture, giving California\'s cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \"Caltrans\". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.[332][333] The Reason Foundation\'s 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California\'s highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.[334]\n\nSan Francisco Bay Ferry is a public water taxi system in the Bay Area.\nThe state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state\'s more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4,200 feet (1,300 m) between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Franciscoâ€“Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the \"Bay Bridge\"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world\'s largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 feet (23 m) wide by 58 feet (18 m) high.[335] The Arroyo Seco Parkway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena, opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.[336] It was later extended south to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first stack interchange ever built.[337]\nThe California Highway Patrol is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in employment with more than 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California\'s state-maintained highways and on state property.\nBy the end of 2021, 30,610,058 people in California held a California Department of Motor Vehicles-issued driver\'s licenses or state identification card, and there were 36,229,205 registered vehicles, including 25,643,076 automobiles, 853,368 motorcycles, 8,981,787 trucks and trailers, and 121,716 miscellaneous vehicles (including historical vehicles and farm equipment).[338]\n\nAir travel\nLos Angeles Intl. Airport (LAX) is the 4th busiest airport in the world.\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.\n\nRailroads\nAmtrak California\'s Pacific Surfliner in San Clemente, on the Orange Coast\nInter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin, are funded by Caltrans. These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records. The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route.[339] Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Metro Rail) and San Francisco (Muni Metro). Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA light rail), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (Sacramento RT Light Rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter). Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (Altamont Corridor Express, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, Sonomaâ€“Marin Area Rail Transit), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority was authorized in 1996 by the state legislature to plan a California High-Speed Rail system to put before the voters. The plan they devised, 2008 California Proposition 1A, connecting all the major population centers in the state, was approved by the voters at the November 2008 general election.[340] The first phase of construction was begun in 2015, and the first segment 171 miles (275 km) long, is planned to be put into operation by the end of 2030. Planning and work on the rest of the system is continuing, with funding for completing it is an ongoing issue.[341] California\'s 2023 integrated passenger rail master plan includes a high speed rail system.[342]\n\nBusses\nNearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway.\n\nWater\nMain article: Water in California\nLake Shasta, in the Shasta Cascade region, is California\'s largest reservoir.\nCalifornia\'s interconnected water system is the world\'s largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre-feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects.[343] Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state\'s widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.\nThe California Water Wars, a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies.[344] Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: \"We\'ve been in crisis for quite some time because we\'re now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water.\"[345]\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe California Capitol in Sacramento, seat of the California government, hosts the California Legislature and the Governor of California.\nState government\nMain article: Government of California\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento.[346]\nThe state is organized into three branches of governmentâ€”the executive branch consisting of the governor[347] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate;[348] and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts.[349] The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification.[350] Before the passage of Proposition 14 in 2010, California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices,[351] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.[352] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.[352] If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held.[352]\n\nExecutive branch\nMain articles: California executive branch, Governor of California, and List of California state agencies\nThe Stanford Mansion is the official reception center for the California government and one of the workplaces of the Governor of California.\nThe California executive branch consists of the governor and seven other elected constitutional officers: lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state controller, state treasurer, insurance commissioner, and state superintendent of public instruction. They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once.[353]\nThe many California state agencies that are under the governor\'s cabinet are grouped together to form cabinet-level entities that are referred to by government officials as \"superagencies\". Those departments that are directly under the other independently elected officers work separately from these superagencies.[354][355]\n\nLegislative branch\nMain article: California Legislature\nThe California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly.[356] Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms.\n\nJudicial branch\nMain article: Judiciary of California\nThe Supreme Court of California is headquartered at the Earl Warren Building (shown) in San Francisco, but also meets in Sacramento and Los Angeles.\nCalifornia\'s legal system is explicitly based upon English common law[357] but carries many features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California\'s prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007.[358] Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \"Death Row\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions).[359][360] California has performed 13 executions since 1976, with the last being in 2006.[361]\nCalifornia\'s judiciary system is the largest in the United States with a total of 1,600 judges (the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven-member Supreme Court of California, while the California Courts of Appeal serve as the primary appellate courts and the California Superior Courts serve as the primary trial courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years.\nThe administration of the state\'s court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature.\nIn fiscal year 2020â€“2021, the state judiciary\'s 2,000 judicial officers and 18,000 judicial branch employees processed approximately 4.4 million cases.[362]\n\nLocal government\nMain article: Local government in California\nSan Francisco City Hall is the seat of government of the consolidated City and County of San Francisco.\nCalifornia has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state. Like most states, California is divided into counties, of which there are 58 (including San Francisco) covering the entire state. Most urbanized areas are incorporated as cities. School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education. Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts.\n\nCounties\nSee also: List of counties in California\nCalifornia is divided into 58 counties. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards.[363][364] In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors.[365]\n\nCity and town governments\nSee also: List of municipalities in California\nLos Angeles City Hall, seat of the Government of Los Angeles\nIncorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities.[190] General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state\'s most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a councilâ€“manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membershipâ€”but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial. The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.\n\nSchool districts and special districts\nSee also: List of school districts in California\nLos Angeles Unified School District is the second largest school district in the United States by enrollment.\nAbout 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California\'s public education.[366] California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.[366]\nThere are about 3,400 special districts in California.[367] A special district, defined by California Government Code Â§ 16271(d) as \"any agency of the state for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries\", provides a limited range of services within a defined geographic area. The geographic area of a special district can spread across multiple cities or counties, or could consist of only a portion of one. Most of California\'s special districts are single-purpose districts, and provide one service.\n\nFederal representation\nMain article: United States congressional delegations from California\nSee also: California\'s congressional districts\nMembers of the California Congressional Delegation in 2020\nThe state of California sends 52 members to the House of Representatives,[368] the nation\'s largest congressional state delegation. Consequently, California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 54. The former speaker of the House of Representatives is the representative of California\'s 20th district, Kevin McCarthy.[369]\nCalifornia is represented in the United States Senate by Alex Padilla, a native and former secretary of state of California, and Laphonza Butler, a labor union official who was appointed to the Senate by Governor Gavin Newson to complete the term of Dianne Feinstein, who died on September 29, 2023. Former U.S. senator Kamala Harris, a native, former district attorney from San Francisco, former attorney general of California, resigned on January 18, 2021, to assume her role as the current Vice President of the United States. In the 1992 U.S. Senate election, California became the first state to elect a Senate delegation entirely composed of women, due to the victories of Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.[370] Following the Vice President, Gov. Newsom appointed Secretary of State Alex Padilla to finish the rest of Harris\'s term which ended in 2022. Padilla successfully ran for a full term that same year. Padilla was sworn in on January 20, 2021, the same day as the inauguration of Joe Biden as well as Harris.[371][372]\n\nArmed forces\nSee also: California during World War II\nView of NAS North Island at Naval Base Coronado in San Diego\nIn California, as of 2009[update], the U.S. Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees. Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California.[373]\nIn 2010, Los Angeles County was the largest origin of military recruits in the United States by county, with 1,437 individuals enlisting in the military.[374] However, as of 2002[update], Californians were relatively under-represented in the military as a proportion to its population.[375]\nIn 2000, California, had 2,569,340 veterans of United States military service: 504,010 served in World War II, 301,034 in the Korean War, 754,682 during the Vietnam War, and 278,003 during 1990â€“2000 (including the Persian Gulf War).[376] As of 2010[update], there were 1,942,775 veterans living in California, of which 1,457,875 served during a period of armed conflict, and just over four thousand served before World War II (the largest population of this group of any state).[377]\nCalifornia\'s military forces consist of the Army and Air National Guard, the naval and state military reserve (militia), and the California Cadet Corps.\nOn August 5, 1950, a nuclear-capable United States Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber carrying a nuclear bomb crashed shortly after takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, command pilot of the bomber, was among the dead.[378]\n\n\nIdeology\nMain articles: Politics of California and Elections in California\nSee also: Politics of California before 1900 and Political party strength in California\n\nCalifornia registered voters as of January 5, 2024[update][379]\n\n\nParty\n\nNumber of voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\nParty registration by county(October 2022):\n\n  Democrat â‰¥ 30%\n  Democrat â‰¥ 40%\n  Democrat â‰¥ 50%\n  Republican â‰¥ 30%\n  Republican â‰¥ 40%\n  Republican â‰¥ 50%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n10,323,214\n\n46.76%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n5,332,858\n\n24.16%\n\n\n\n\nNo Party Preference\n\n4,845,113\n\n21.95%\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Independent\n\n835,277\n\n3.78%\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\n242,770\n\n1.10%\n\n\n\n\nPeace and Freedom\n\n133,914\n\n0.61%\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\n102,599\n\n0.46%\n\n\nOther\n\n261,667\n\n1.19%\n\n\nTotal\n\n22,077,412\n\n100%\n\nCalifornia has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.[380] In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In the 2016 United States presidential election, California had the third highest percentage of Democratic votes behind the District of Columbia and Hawaii.[381] In the 2020 United States presidential election, it had the 6th highest behind the District of Columbia, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Hawaii. According to the Cook Political Report, California contains five of the 15 most Democratic congressional districts in the United States.\nAmong the political idiosyncrasies, California was the second state to recall their state governor (the first state being North Dakota in 1921), the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, making California the second state to legalize stem cell research after New Jersey, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state\'s primary election process. California has also experienced disputes over water rights; and a tax revolt, culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting state property taxes. California voters have rejected affirmative action on multiple occasions, most recently in November 2020.\nThe state\'s trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor Gavin Newsom; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party.\n\nAnti-war protesters and pro-military counterprotesters in Berkeley (2008)\nSeveral political movements have advocated for California independence. The California National Party and the California Freedom Coalition both advocate for California independence along the lines of progressivism and civic nationalism.[382] The Yes California movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via ballot initiative for 2019, which was then postponed.[383]\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 62 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the Assembly; and 32 Democrats and 8 Republicans in the Senate.\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From 1952 through 1988, California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state\'s electoral votes in nine of ten elections, with 1964 as the exception. Southern California Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California\'s electoral votes for the last eight elections, starting in 1992.\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34â€“19 edge in the CA delegation of the 110th United States Congress in 2007. As the result of gerrymandering, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38â€“15 majority in the delegation. Following the 2018 midterm House elections, Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nOccupy Los Angeles movement (2011)\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. Orange County had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county\'s votes were cast for Democratic candidates.[384][385] One study ranked Berkeley, Oakland, Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and Bakersfield, Orange, Escondido, Garden Grove, and Simi Valley in the top 20 most conservative cities.[386]\nIn October 2022, out of the 26,876,800 people eligible to vote, 21,940,274 people were registered to vote.[387] Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (10,283,258), Republicans (5,232,094), and No Party Preference (4,943,696).[387] Los Angeles County had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,996,565) and Republicans (958,851) of any county in the state.[387]\nCalifornia retains the death penalty, though it has not been used since 2006.[388] There is currently a gubernatorial hold on executions. Authorized methods of execution include the gas chamber.[389]\n\nTwinned regions\nCalifornia has region twinning arrangements with:\n\n Catalonia, autonomous community of  Spain[390]\n Alberta, province of  Canada[73][391]\n Jeju Province of  South Korea[392]\n Guangdong, province of  China[393]\nSee also\nIndex of California-related articles\nOutline of California\nList of people from California\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n^ The summit of Mount Whitney is the highest point in the Contiguous United States.\n\n^ The coordinates of the center of population are at 35Â°29â€²28â€³N 119Â°20â€²52â€³Wï»¿ / ï»¿35.491035Â°N 119.347852Â°Wï»¿ / 35.491035; -119.347852.[216]\n\n^ Behind Nevada and Arizona\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n^ The following are a list of the indigenous languages: Root languages of California: Athabaskan Family: Hupa, Mattole, Lassik, Wailaki, Sinkyone, Cahto, Tolowa, Nongatl, Wiyot, Chilula; Hokan Family: Pomo, Shasta, Karok, Chimiriko; Algonquian Family: Whilkut, Yurok; Yukian Family: Wappo; Penutian Family: Modok, Wintu, Nomlaki, Konkow, Maidu, Patwin, Nisenan, Miwok, Coast Miwok, Lake Miwok, Ohlone, Northern Valley Yokuts, Southern Valley Yokuts, Foothill Yokuts; Hokan Family: Esselen, Salinan, Chumash, Ipai, Tipai, Yuma, Halchichoma, Mohave; Uto-Aztecan Family: Mono Paiute, Monache, Owens Valley Paiute, Tubatulabal, Panamint Shoshone, Kawaisu, Kitanemuk, Tataviam, Gabrielino, Juaneno, Luiseno, Cuipeno, Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi\n\n^ ABC has the least amount of owned-and-operated TV stations with three: KABC-TV in Los Angeles, KGO-TV in San Francisco, and KFSN-TV in Fresno.\n\n^ Minnesota also has a moratorium on construction of nuclear power plants, which has been in place since 1994.[331]\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\n^ \"California\". www.americaslibrary.gov.

Colorado borders Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and meets Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. Colorado is noted for its landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. Colorado is one of the Mountain States and is often considered to be part of the southwestern United States. The high plains of Colorado may be considered a part of the midwestern United States. It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains, as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is the eighth most extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. The United States Census Bureau estimated the population of Colorado at 5,877,610 as of July 1, 2023, a 1.80% increase since the 2020 United States census.[11]\nThe region has been inhabited by Native Americans and their ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. In 1848, much of the Nuevo MÃ©xico region was annexed to the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Pike\'s Peak Gold Rush of 1858â€“1862 created an influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act creating the Territory of Colorado,[2] and on August 1, 1876, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state.[3] The Spanish adjective \"colorado\" means \"colored red\" or \"ruddy\". Colorado is nicknamed the \"Centennial State\" because it became a state one century (and four weeks) after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence.\nDenver is the capital, the most populous city, and the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor. Colorado Springs is the second most populous city. Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although the antiquated \"Coloradoan\" is occasionally used.[12][13] Major parts of the economy include government and defense, mining, agriculture, tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing. With increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability, Colorado\'s agriculture, forestry, and tourism economies are expected to be heavily affected by climate change.[14]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain articles: Prehistory of Colorado and History of Colorado\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Colorado history.\nThe ruins of the Cliff Palace of Mesa Verde, photographed by Gustaf NordenskiÃ¶ld in 1891\nGreat Kiva at Chimney Rock in the San Juan Mountains of Southwestern Colorado. It was built by the Ancient Pueblo peoples.\nThe region that is today the State of Colorado has been inhabited by Native Americans and their Paleoamerican ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly more than 37,000 years.[15][16] The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The Lindenmeier site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 8720 BCE. The Ancient Pueblo peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the Colorado Plateau.[17] The Ute Nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Western Rocky Mountains, even as far east as the Front Range of the present day. The Apache and the Comanche also inhabited the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. In the 17th century, the Arapaho and Cheyenne moved west from the Great Lakes region to hunt across the High Plains of Colorado and Wyoming.\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of Nuevo MÃ©xico. The U.S. acquired the territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper Arkansas River Basin. In 1806, Zebulon Pike led a U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his troops were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the San Luis Valley the following February, taken to Chihuahua, and expelled from Mexico the following July.\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the Arkansas River and south of 42nd parallel north and west of the 100th meridian west as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the Adams-OnÃ­s Treaty of 1819. The treaty took effect on February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the Territory of Missouri to the Union as the state of Missouri on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became an unorganized territory and remained so for 33 years over the question of slavery. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the Treaty of CÃ³rdoba signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adamsâ€“OnÃ­s Treaty in 1831. The Texian Revolt of 1835â€“36 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the Mexicanâ€“American War in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the war in 1848; this included much of the western and southern areas of Colorado.\n\nMap of the Mexican Cession, with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the Republic of Texas) after the Mexicanâ€“American War. Well over half of Colorado was received from this treaty.\nMost American settlers first traveled to Colorado through the Santa Fe Trail, which connected the U.S. to Santa Fe and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro southward. Others were traveling overland west to the Oregon Country, the new goldfields of California, or the new Mormon settlements of the State of Deseret in the Salt Lake Valley, avoided the rugged Southern Rocky Mountains, and instead followed the North Platte River and Sweetwater River to South Pass (Wyoming), the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal State of Deseret, claiming the entire Great Basin and all lands drained by the rivers Green, Grand, and Colorado. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government because it was theocratic and sanctioned plural marriage. Instead, the Compromise of 1850 divided the Mexican Cession and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the state of California, the Territory of New Mexico, and the Territory of Utah. On April 9, 1851, Hispano settlers from the area of Taos settled the village of San Luis, then in the New Mexico Territory, as Colorado\'s first permanent Euro-American settlement, further cementing the traditions of New Mexican cuisine and New Mexico music in the developing Southern Rocky Mountain Front.[18][19]\n\nThe Canyons of the Ancients Visitor Center & Museum in Dolores\nIn 1854, Senator Stephen A. Douglas persuaded the U.S. Congress to divide the unorganized territory east of the Continental Divide into two new organized territories, the Territory of Kansas and the Territory of Nebraska, and an unorganized southern region known as the Indian Territory. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between free soil and pro-slavery factions.\nThe gold seekers organized the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the Congress of the United States embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of Abraham Lincoln for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states. Seeking to augment the political power of the Union states, the Republican Party-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the Territory of Kansas into the Union as the free State of Kansas on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\nTerritory act[edit]\nMain articles: Organic act Â§ List of organic acts, New Mexico Territory, Utah Territory, Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act, Kansas Territory, Nebraska Territory, Colorado Territory, and Pike\'s Peak Gold Rush\nThe territories of New Mexico, Utah, Kansas, and Nebraska before the creation of the Territory of Colorado\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President James Buchanan signed an Act of Congress organizing the free Territory of Colorado.[2] The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. In 1776, Spanish priest Silvestre VÃ©lez de Escalante recorded that Native Americans in the area knew the river as el Rio Colorado for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.[20][failed verification] In 1859, a U.S. Army topographic expedition led by Captain John Macomb located the confluence of the Green River with the Grand River in what is now Canyonlands National Park in Utah.[21] The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.\nOn April 12, 1861, South Carolina artillery opened fire on Fort Sumter to start the American Civil War. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the Confederacy, the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the Union cause.\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the Territory of New Mexico and captured Santa Fe on March 10. The object of this Western Campaign was to seize or disrupt Colorado and California\'s gold fields and seize Pacific Ocean ports for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from Denver City, Colorado Territory, to Glorieta Pass, New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.[22] The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to San Antonio in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nMount of the Holy Cross, photographed by William Henry Jackson in 1874\nIn 1864, Territorial Governor John Evans appointed the Reverend John Chivington as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his troops to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that the bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President Andrew Johnson asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the Sand Creek massacre.\nIn the midst and aftermath of the Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near Argentine Pass, the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the Union Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west to Weir, now Julesburg, in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit, Utah, on May 10, 1869, to form the First transcontinental railroad. The Denver Pacific Railway reached Denver in June of the following year, and the Kansas Pacific arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the San Juan Mountains on the Ute Indian reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.\n\nStatehood[edit]\nMain articles: Admission to the Union, List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union, Colorado Silver Boom, and Cripple Creek Gold Rush\nThe Georgetown Loop of the Colorado Central Railroad as photographed by William Henry Jackson in 1899\nThe United States Congress passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the Territory of Colorado to become a state.[23] On August 1, 1876 (four weeks after the Centennial of the United States), U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state and earning it the moniker \"Centennial State\".[3]\nThe discovery of a major silver lode near Leadville in 1878 triggered the Colorado Silver Boom. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado\'s last, but greatest, gold strike at Cripple Creek a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant universal suffrage and the first one by a popular vote (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered. Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver\'s floriculture industry developed into a major industry in Colorado.[24][25] This period became known locally as the Carnation Gold Rush.[26]\n\nTwentieth and twenty-first centuries[edit]\nPoor labor conditions and discontent among miners resulted in several major clashes between strikers and the Colorado National Guard, including the 1903â€“1904 Western Federation of Miners Strike and Colorado Coalfield War, the latter of which included the Ludlow massacre that killed a dozen women and children.[27][28] Both the 1913â€“1914 Coalfield War and the Denver streetcar strike of 1920 resulted in federal troops intervening to end the violence.[29] In 1927, the 1927-28 Colorado coal strike occurred and was ultimately successful in winning a dollar a day increase in wages.[30][31] During it however the Columbine Mine massacre resulted in six dead strikers following a confrontation with Colorado Rangers.[32][33] In a separate incident in Trinidad the mayor was accused of deputizing members of the KKK against the striking workers.[34] More than 5,000 Colorado minersâ€”many immigrantsâ€”are estimated to have died in accidents since records were first formally collected following an 1884 accident in Crested Butte that killed 59.[35]\nIn 1924, the Ku Klux Klan Colorado Realm achieved dominance in Colorado politics. With peak membership levels, the Second Klan levied significant control over both the local and state Democrat and Republican parties, particularly in the governor\'s office and city governments of Denver, CaÃ±on City, and Durango. A particularly strong element of the Klan controlled the Denver Police.[36] Cross burnings became semi-regular occurrences in cities such as Florence and Pueblo. The Klan targeted African-Americans, Catholics, Eastern European immigrants, and other non-White Protestant groups.[37] Efforts by non-Klan lawmen and lawyers including Philip Van Cise led to a rapid decline in the organization\'s power, with membership waning significantly by the end of the 1920s.[36]\n\nThree 10th Mountain Division skitroopers above Camp Hale in February 1944\nColorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the Democratic Party met in Denver in 1908. By the U.S. census in 1930, the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado\'s fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.\nOn September 11, 1957, a plutonium fire occurred at the Rocky Flats Plant, which resulted in the significant plutonium contamination of surrounding populated areas.[38]\nFrom the 1940s and 1970s, many protest movements gained momentum in Colorado, predominantly in Denver. This included the Chicano Movement, a civil rights, and social movement of Mexican Americans emphasizing a Chicano identity that is widely considered to have begun in Denver.[39] The National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference was held in Colorado in March 1969.[40]\nIn 1967, Colorado was the first state to loosen restrictions on abortion when governor John Love signed a law allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the woman\'s mental or physical health. Many states followed Colorado\'s lead in loosening abortion laws in the 1960s and 1970s.[41]\nSince the late 1990s, Colorado has been the site of multiple major mass shootings, including the infamous Columbine High School massacre in 1999 which made international news, where two gunmen killed 12 students and one teacher, before committing suicide. The incident has spawned many copycat incidents.[42] On July 20, 2012, a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora. The state responded with tighter restrictions on firearms, including introducing a limit on magazine capacity.[43] On March 22, 2021, a gunman killed 10 people, including a police officer, in a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder.[44] In an instance of anti-LGBT violence, a gunman killed 5 people at a nightclub in Colorado Springs during the night of November 19â€“20, 2022.[45]\nFour warships of the U.S. Navy have been named the USS Colorado. The first USS Colorado was named for the Colorado River and served in the Civil War and later the Asiatic Squadron, where it was attacked during the 1871 Korean Expedition. The later three ships were named in honor of the state, including an armored cruiser and the battleship USS Colorado, the latter of which was the lead ship of her class and served in World War II in the Pacific beginning in 1941. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship USS Colorado was located at the naval base in San Diego, California, and thus went unscathed. The most recent vessel to bear the name USS Colorado is Virginia-class submarine USS Colorado (SSN-788), which was commissioned in 2018.[46]\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Colorado\n\nColorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. In 1861, the United States Congress defined the boundaries of the new Territory of Colorado exclusively by lines of latitude and longitude, stretching from 37Â°N to 41Â°N latitude, and from 102Â°02â€²48â€³W to 109Â°02â€²48â€³W longitude (25Â°W to 32Â°W from the Washington Meridian).[2] After 163 years of government surveys, the borders of Colorado were officially defined by 697 boundary markers and 697 straight boundary lines.[47] Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah are the only states that have their borders defined solely by straight boundary lines with no natural features.[48] The southwest corner of Colorado is the Four Corners Monument at 36Â°59â€²56â€³N, 109Â°2â€²43â€³W.[49][b] The Four Corners Monument, located at the place where Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah meet, is the only place in the United States where four states meet.[48]\n\nPlains[edit]\nThe arid high plains in Southeastern Colorado\nApproximately half of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains is the Colorado Eastern Plains of the High Plains, the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly 3,350 to 7,500 feet (1,020 to 2,290 m).[50] The Colorado plains are mostly prairies but also include deciduous forests, buttes, and canyons. Precipitation averages 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 mm) annually.[51]\nEastern Colorado is presently mainly farmland and rangeland, along with small farming villages and towns. Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through artesian wells. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.[52]\n\nFront Range[edit]\nFront Range Peaks west of Denver\nRoughly 70% of Colorado\'s population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the Front Range Urban Corridor between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Pueblo, Colorado. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in western Colorado (which is known as \"The Western Slope\") are the cities of Grand Junction, Durango, and Montrose.\n\nMountains[edit]\n\n\nMap this section\'s coordinates in \"List of mountain peaks of Colorado\" using OpenStreetMap\nshow links\nDownload coordinates as:\n\n\nKML\nGPX (all coordinates)\nGPX (primary coordinates)\nGPX (secondary coordinates)\n\n\n\nSee also: List of mountain peaks of Colorado\nMount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,401.2 m) is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains and Colorado.\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include Longs Peak, Mount Blue Sky, Pikes Peak, and the Spanish Peaks near Walsenburg, in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the Mississippi River or the Rio Grande into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 true peaks with a total of 58 that are 14,000 feet (4,267 m) or higher in elevation above sea level, known as fourteeners.[53] These mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line, at an elevation of about 12,000 feet (3,658 m) in southern Colorado to about 10,500 feet (3,200 m) in northern Colorado. Above this tree line, only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August except for a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The Colorado Mineral Belt, stretching from the San Juan Mountains in the southwest to Boulder and Central City on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains. The 30 highest major summits of the Rocky Mountains of North America are all within the state.\nThe summit of Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,401.2 m) elevation in Lake County is the highest point in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains of North America.[5] Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above 1,000 meters elevation. The point where the Arikaree River flows out of Yuma County, Colorado, and into Cheyenne County, Kansas, is the lowest in Colorado at 3,317 feet (1,011 m) elevation. This point, which is the highest low elevation point of any state,[6][54] is higher than the high elevation points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nContinental Divide[edit]\nGrays Peak, at 14,278 feet (4,352 m), is the highest point on the Continental Divide in North America.\nThe Continental Divide of the Americas extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the Western Slope of Colorado. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the Colorado River and the Green River into the Gulf of California.\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the North Park of Colorado. The North Park is drained by the North Platte River, which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the Middle Park of Colorado, which is drained by the Colorado River. The South Park of Colorado is the region of the headwaters of the South Platte River.\n\nSouth Central region[edit]\nThe high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado\nIn south-central Colorado is the large San Luis Valley, where the headwaters of the Rio Grande are located. The northern part of the valley is the San Luis Closed Basin, an endorheic basin that helped created the Great Sand Dunes. The valley sits between the Sangre De Cristo Mountains and San Juan Mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. Across the Sangre de Cristo Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the Rio Grande Rift, a major geological formation of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n\nWestern Slope[edit]\nMaroon Bells, at 14,163 ft (4,317 m), is part of White River National Forest and a tourist destination\nThe Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.\nThe Western Slope of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the area to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west to Utah. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\nThe northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted Dinosaur National Monument, which not only is a paleontological area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the Gunnison River, Green River, and the San Juan River). The Colorado River flows through Glenwood Canyon, and then through an arid valley made up of desert from Rifle to Parachute, through the desert canyon of De Beque Canyon, and into the arid desert of Grand Valley, where the city of Grand Junction is located.\nAlso prominent is the Grand Mesa, which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the north and west of the San Juan Mountains, the Colorado Plateau.\nGrand Junction, Colorado, at the confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers, is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of television broadcasting west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located at the juncture of Interstate 70 and US 50, the only major highways in western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the Union Pacific. This railroad also provides the tracks for Amtrak\'s California Zephyr passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction.\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including Glenwood Springs, with its resort hot springs, and the ski resorts of Aspen, Breckenridge, Vail, Crested Butte, Steamboat Springs, and Telluride.\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Western Colorado University in Gunnison, Fort Lewis College in Durango, and Colorado Mountain College in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\nThe Four Corners Monument in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah; the only such place in the United States.\n\nSee also: List of cities and towns in Colorado, List of counties in Colorado, List of rivers of Colorado, and Four Corners Monument\nClimate[edit]\nKÃ¶ppen climate types of Colorado, using 1991-2020 climate normals\nThe climate of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the Mountain States region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect the local climate.  Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\nEastern Plains[edit]\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is semi-arid (KÃ¶ppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 millimeters) annually, although many areas near the rivers are semi-humid climate. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average diurnal temperature range. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced precipitation shadow as a result of being on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains.[55]\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95 Â°F (35 Â°C) and often 100 Â°F (38 Â°C).[56] On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to âˆ’10 Â°F (âˆ’4 to âˆ’23 Â°C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.[57]\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to Chinook winds which warms the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70 Â°F (21 Â°C) or higher in the winter.[57] The average July temperature is 55 Â°F (13 Â°C) in the morning and 90 Â°F (32 Â°C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18 Â°F (âˆ’8 Â°C) in the morning and 48 Â°F (9 Â°C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40 Â°F (22 Â°C).\n\nFront Range foothills[edit]\nJust west of the plains and into the foothills, there is a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an alpine climate at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (Cfb/Cwb), humid subtropical (Cfa), humid continental (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterranean (Csa/Csb) and subarctic (Dfc).[58]\n\nExtreme weather[edit]\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state. Hail is the most commonly reported warm-season severe weather hazard, and occasionally causes human injuries, as well as significant property damage.[59] The eastern Plains are subject to some of the biggest hail storms in North America.[51] Notable examples are the severe hailstorms that hit Denver on July 11, 1990,[60] and May 8, 2017, the latter being the costliest ever in the state.[61]\nThe Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of Tornado Alley; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated a small town.[62] Portions of the eastern Plains see especially frequent tornadoes, both those spawned from mesocyclones in supercell thunderstorms and from less intense landspouts, such as within the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ).[59]\nThe Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the 1965 Denver Flood,[63] the Big Thompson River flooding of 1976 and the 2013 Colorado floods. Hot weather is common during summers in Denver. The city\'s record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90 Â°F (32 Â°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.[64]\nMuch of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only 17 inches (430 millimeters) of precipitation per year statewide. The state rarely experiences a time when some portion is not in some degree of drought.[65] The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the Hayman Fire of 2002. Other notable fires include the Fourmile Canyon Fire of 2010, the Waldo Canyon Fire and High Park Fire of June 2012, and the Black Forest Fire of June 2013. Even these fires were exceeded in severity by the Pine Gulch Fire, Cameron Peak Fire, and East Troublesome Fire in 2020, all being the three largest fires in Colorado history (see 2020 Colorado wildfires). And the Marshall Fire which started on December 30, 2021, while not the largest in state history, was the most destructive ever in terms of property loss (see Marshall Fire).\nHowever, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the Yampa River, the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.\nWater flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.\n\nClimate change[edit]\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Climate change in Colorado.[edit]\nClimate change in Colorado encompasses the effects of climate change, attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, in the U.S. state of Colorado.\nIn 2019 The Denver Post reported that \"[i]ndividuals living in southeastern Colorado are more vulnerable to potential health effects from climate change than residents in other parts of the state\".[66] The United States Environmental Protection Agency has more broadly reported:\n\n\"Colorado\'s climate is changing. Most of the state has warmed one or two degrees (F) in the last century. Throughout the western United States, heat waves are becoming more common, snow is melting earlier in spring, and less water flows through the Colorado River.[67][68] Rising temperatures[69] and recent droughts[70] in the region have killed many trees by drying out soils, increasing the risk of forest fires, or enabling outbreaks of forest insects. In the coming decades, the changing climate is likely to decrease water availability and agricultural yields in Colorado, and further increase the risk of wildfires\".[71]\nRecords[edit]\nThe highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115 Â°F (46.1 Â°C) on July 20, 2019, at John Martin Dam. The lowest official air temperature was âˆ’61 Â°F (âˆ’51.7 Â°C) on February 1, 1985, at Maybell.[72][73]\n\n\nMonthly normal high and low temperatures for various Colorado cities[74]\n\n(Â°F) (Â°C)\n\n\nCity\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\n\nAlamosa\n\n34/âˆ’22/âˆ’19\n\n40/64/âˆ’14\n\n50/1710/âˆ’8\n\n59/2415/âˆ’4\n\n69/3321/1\n\n79/4126/5\n\n82/4728/8\n\n80/4627/8\n\n73/4023/4\n\n62/2517/âˆ’4\n\n47/128/âˆ’11\n\n35/12/âˆ’17\n\n\nColorado Springs\n\n43/186/âˆ’8\n\n45/207/âˆ’7\n\n52/2611/âˆ’3\n\n60/3316/1\n\n69/4321/6\n\n79/5126/11\n\n85/5729/14\n\n82/5628/13\n\n75/4724/8\n\n63/3617/2\n\n51/2511/âˆ’4\n\n42/186/âˆ’8\n\n\nDenver\n\n49/209/âˆ’7\n\n49/219/âˆ’6\n\n56/2913/âˆ’2\n\n64/3518/2\n\n73/4623/8\n\n84/5429/12\n\n92/6133/16\n\n89/6032/16\n\n81/5027/10\n\n68/3720/3\n\n55/2613/âˆ’3\n\n47/188/âˆ’8\n\n\nGrand Junction\n\n38/173/âˆ’8\n\n45/247/âˆ’4\n\n57/3114/-1\n\n65/3818/3\n\n76/4724/8\n\n88/5631/13\n\n93/6334/17\n\n90/6132/16\n\n80/5227/11\n\n66/4019/4\n\n51/2811/âˆ’2\n\n39/194/âˆ’7\n\n\nPueblo\n\n47/148/âˆ’10\n\n51/1711/âˆ’8\n\n59/2615/âˆ’3\n\n67/3419/1\n\n77/4425/7\n\n87/5331/12\n\n93/5934/15\n\n90/5832/14\n\n82/4828/9\n\n69/3421/1\n\n56/2313/âˆ’5\n\n46/148/âˆ’10\n\nExtreme temperatures[edit]\n\n\n\nhideClimate data for Colorado\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high Â°F (Â°C)\n\n84(29)\n\n88(31)\n\n96(36)\n\n100(38)\n\n107(42)\n\n114(46)\n\n115(46)\n\n112(44)\n\n108(42)\n\n100(38)\n\n90(32)\n\n88(31)\n\n115(46)\n\n\nRecord low Â°F (Â°C)\n\nâˆ’56(âˆ’49)\n\nâˆ’61(âˆ’52)\n\nâˆ’44(âˆ’42)\n\nâˆ’30(âˆ’34)\n\nâˆ’11(âˆ’24)\n\n10(âˆ’12)\n\n18(âˆ’8)\n\n15(âˆ’9)\n\nâˆ’2(âˆ’19)\n\nâˆ’28(âˆ’33)\n\nâˆ’37(âˆ’38)\n\nâˆ’50(âˆ’46)\n\nâˆ’61(âˆ’52)\n\n\nSource: Colorado Climate Center[75]\n\n\nEarthquakes[edit]\nDespite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively quiet seismically. The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center is located in Golden.[citation needed]\nOn August 22, 2011, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake occurred 9 miles (14 km) west-southwest of the city of Trinidad.[76] There were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported. It was the second-largest earthquake in Colorado\'s history, the largest being a magnitude 6.6 earthquake, recorded in 1882.[77] Four minor earthquakes rattled Colorado on August 24, 2018, ranging from magnitude 2.9 to 4.3.[78] As of June 2020[update], there were 525 recorded earthquakes in Colorado since 1973, a majority of which range 2 to 3.5 on the Richter scale.[79]\n\nFauna[edit]\nFurther information on the lists of: amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles\nBreckenridge naturalist Edwin Carter with a mounted gray wolf killed in the Colorado Rockies, ca. 1890â€“1900\nA process of extirpation by trapping and poisoning of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) from Colorado in the 1930s saw the last wild wolf in the state shot in 1945.[80] A wolf pack recolonized Moffat County, Colorado in northwestern Colorado in 2019.[81] Cattle farmers have expressed concern that a returning wolf population potentially threatens their herds.[80] Coloradans voted to reintroduce gray wolves in 2020, with the state committing to a plan to have a population in the state by 2022 and permitting non-lethal methods of driving off wolves attacking livestock and pets.[82][83]\nWhile there is fossil evidence of Harrington\'s mountain goat in Colorado between at least 800,000 years ago and its extinction with megafauna roughly 11,000 years ago, the mountain goat is not native to Colorado but was instead introduced to the state over time during the interval between 1947 and 1972. Despite being an artificially-introduced species, the state declared mountain goats a native species in 1993.[84] In 2013, 2014, and 2019, an unknown illness killed nearly all mountain goat kids, leading to a Colorado Parks and Wildlife investigation.[85][86]\nThe native population of pronghorn in Colorado has varied wildly over the last century, reaching a low of only 15,000 individuals during the 1960s. However, conservation efforts succeeded in bringing the stable population back up to roughly 66,000 by 2013.[87] The population was estimated to have reached 85,000 by 2019 and had increasingly more run-ins with the increased suburban housing along the eastern Front Range. State wildlife officials suggested that landowners would need to modify fencing to allow the greater number of pronghorns to move unabated through the newly developed land.[88] Pronghorns are most readily found in the northern and eastern portions of the state, with some populations also in the western San Juan Mountains.[89]\nCommon wildlife found in the mountains of Colorado include mule deer, southwestern red squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel, yellow-bellied marmot, moose, American pika, and red fox, all at exceptionally high numbers, though moose are not native to the state.[90][91][92][93] The foothills include deer, fox squirrel, desert cottontail, mountain cottontail, and coyote.[94][95] The prairies are home to black-tailed prairie dog, the endangered swift fox, American badger, and white-tailed jackrabbit.[96][97][98]\n\nCounties[edit]\n\n\nMap this section\'s coordinates in \"Population history of Colorado counties\" using OpenStreetMap\nshow links\nDownload coordinates as:\n\n\nKML\nGPX (all coordinates)\nGPX (primary coordinates)\nGPX (secondary coordinates)\n\n\n\nMain articles: List of counties in Colorado and List of Colorado counties by socioeconomic factors\nThe State of Colorado is divided into 64 counties. Two of these counties, the City and County of Broomfield and the City and County of Denver, have consolidated city and county governments. Counties are important units of government in Colorado since there are no civil townships or other minor civil divisions.\nThe most populous county in Colorado is El Paso County, the home of the City of Colorado Springs. The second most populous county is the City and County of Denver, the state capital. Five of the 64 counties now have more than 500,000 residents, while 12 have fewer than 5,000 residents.

Another 714,417 residents (12.37%) lived in one of the 210 census-designated places, while the remaining 759,355 residents (13.15%) lived in the many rural and mountainous areas of the state.[11]\nColorado municipalities operate under one of five types of municipal governing authority. Colorado currently has two consolidated city and county governments, 61 home rule cities, 12 statutory cities, 35 home rule towns, 161 statutory towns, and one territorial charter municipality.\nThe most populous municipality is the City and County of Denver. Colorado has 12 municipalities with more than 100,000 residents, and 17 with fewer than 100 residents. The 16 most populous Colorado municipalities are all located in the Front Range Urban Corridor. The City of Grand Junction is the most populous municipality on the Colorado Western Slope.

These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.\nSome of these districts have the authority to levy sales tax as well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n\nThe Regional Transportation District (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\nThe Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\nIt is a 0.1% retail sales and uses tax (one penny on every $10).\nAccording to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement, or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history, or cultural history.\nAs directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\nTier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\nTier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\nTier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding from the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\nAn 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions by the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.\nThe Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the Denver Broncos\' stadium Empower Field at Mile High.\nLocal Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of Jefferson and Broomfield counties.\nThe Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the Colorado Rockies\' stadium Coors Field.\nRegional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, and Gunnison County.\nStatistical areas[edit]\nMain article: List of statistical areas in Colorado\nAn enlargeable map of the 17 core-based statistical areas of Colorado\nMost recently on March 6, 2020, the Office of Management and Budget defined 21 statistical areas for Colorado comprising four combined statistical areas, seven metropolitan statistical areas, and ten micropolitan statistical areas.[104]\nThe most populous of the seven metropolitan statistical areas in Colorado is the 10-county Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area with a population of 2,963,821 at the 2020 United States census, an increase of +15.29% since the 2010 census.[11]\nThe more extensive 12-county Denver-Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area had a population of 3,623,560 at the 2020 census, an increase of +17.23% since the 2010 census.[11]\nThe most populous extended metropolitan region in Rocky Mountain Region is the 18-county Front Range Urban Corridor along the northeast face of the Southern Rocky Mountains.

Persons reporting German ancestry are especially numerous in the Front Range, the Rockies (west-central counties), and Eastern parts/High Plains.\nColorado has a high proportion of Hispanic, mostly Mexican-American, citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado have a large number of Hispanos, the descendants of the early settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Colorado\'s population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic White.[112] The Hispanic population of Colorado has continued to grow quickly over the past decades. By 2019, Hispanics made up 22% of Colorado\'s population, and Non-Hispanic Whites made up 70%.[113] Spoken English in Colorado has many Spanish idioms.[114]\nColorado also has some large African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of Mongolian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Southeast Asian, and Japanese descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver\'s southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.\nThe population of Native Americans in the state is small. Native Americans are concentrated in metropolitan Denver and the southwestern corner of Colorado, where there are two Ute reservations.[115]\nThe majority of Colorado\'s immigrants are from Mexico, India, China, Vietnam, Korea, Germany and Canada.[116]\nThere were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth rate of 14.6 per thousand.) In 2007, non-Hispanic Whites were involved in 59.1% of all births.[117] Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic White person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic. A birth where at least one Hispanic person was involved counted for 43% of the births in Colorado.[118] As of the 2010 census, Colorado has the seventh highest percentage of Hispanics (20.7%) in the U.S. behind New Mexico (46.3%), California (37.6%), Texas (37.6%), Arizona (29.6%), Nevada (26.5%), and Florida (22.5%). Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899, or approximately 20% of the state\'s total population. Colorado has the 5th-largest population of Mexican-Americans, behind California, Texas, Arizona, and Illinois. In percentages, Colorado has the 6th-highest percentage of Mexican-Americans, behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.[119]\n\nBirth data[edit]\nIn 2011, 46% of Colorado\'s population younger than the age of one were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic White.[120][121]\nNote: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\n\nLive births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n\n\nRace\n\n2013[122]\n\n2014[123]\n\n2015[124]\n\n2016[125]\n\n2017[126]\n\n2018[127]\n\n2019[128]\n\n2020[129]\n\n2021[130]\n\n2022[131]\n\n\nWhite:\n\n57,491 (88.4%)\n\n58,117 (88.3%)\n\n58,756 (88.2%)\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n> Non-Hispanic White\n\n39,872 (61.3%)\n\n40,629 (61.7%)\n\n40,878 (61.4%)\n\n39,617 (59.5%)\n\n37,516 (58.3%)\n\n36,466 (58.0%)\n\n36,022 (57.3%)\n\n34,924 (56.8%)\n\n36,334 (57.7%)\n\n35,076 (56.2%)\n\n\nBlack\n\n3,760 (5.8%)\n\n3,926 (6.0%)\n\n4,049 (6.1%)\n\n3,004 (4.5%)\n\n3,110 (4.8%)\n\n3,032 (4.8%)\n\n3,044 (4.8%)\n\n3,146 (5.1%)\n\n2,988 (4.7%)\n\n2,981 (4.8%)\n\n\nAsian\n\n2,863 (4.4%)\n\n3,010 (4.6%)\n\n2,973 (4.5%)\n\n2,617 (3.9%)\n\n2,611 (4.1%)\n\n2,496 (4.0%)\n\n2,540 (4.0%)\n\n2,519 (4.1%)\n\n2,490 (4.0%)\n\n2,450 (3.9%)\n\n\nAmerican Indian\n\n793 (1.2%)\n\n777 (1.2%)\n\n803 (1.2%)\n\n412 (0.6%)\n\n421 (0.7%)\n\n352 (0.6%)\n\n365 (0.6%)\n\n338 (0.5%)\n\n323 (0.5%)\n\n336 (0.5%)\n\n\nPacific Islander\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n145 (0.2%)\n\n145 (0.2%)\n\n155 (0.2%)\n\n168 (0.3%)\n\n169 (0.3%)\n\n202 (0.3%)\n\n203 (0.3%)\n\n\nHispanic (of any race)\n\n17,821 (27.4%)\n\n17,665 (26.8%)\n\n18,139 (27.2%)\n\n18,513 (27.8%)\n\n18,125 (28.2%)\n\n17,817 (28.3%)\n\n18,205 (29.0%)\n\n18,111 (29.4%)\n\n18,362 (29.2%)\n\n18,982 (30.4%)\n\n\nTotal Colorado\n\n65,007 (100%)\n\n65,830 (100%)\n\n66,581 (100%)\n\n66,613 (100%)\n\n64,382 (100%)\n\n62,885 (100%)\n\n62,869 (100%)\n\n61,494 (100%)\n\n62,949 (100%)\n\n62,383 (100%)\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\nIn 2017, Colorado recorded the second-lowest fertility rate in the United States outside of New England, after Oregon, at 1.63 children per woman.[126] Significant contributing factors to the decline in pregnancies were the  Title X Family Planning Program and an intrauterine device grant from Warren Buffett\'s family.[132][133]\n\nLanguage[edit]\nSee also: Native American languages of Colorado\nEnglish, the official language of the state, is the most commonly spoken in Colorado.[134] One Native American language still spoken in Colorado is the Colorado River Numic language also known as the Ute dialect.\nThe most common non-English language spoken in the state is Spanish.[135]\n\nReligion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute\'s 2022 American Values Survey[136]\n\n  Protestantism (39%)  Catholicism (19%)  Mormonism (2%)  Eastern Orthodoxy (1%)  Unitarianism/Universalism (1%)  Unaffiliated (34%)  New Age (2%)  Judaism (1%)  Hinduism (1%)  East Asian Related Religion (2%)\n\n\nMajor religious affiliations of the people of Colorado as of 2014 were 64% Christian, of whom there are 44% Protestant, 16% Roman Catholic, 3% Mormon, and 1% Eastern Orthodox.[137] Other religious breakdowns according to the Pew Research Center were 1% Jewish, 1% Muslim, 1% Buddhist and 4% other. The religiously unaffiliated made up 29% of the population.[138] In 2020, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, Christianity was 66% of the population. Judaism was also reported to have increased in this separate study, forming 2% of the religious landscape, while the religiously unaffiliated were reported to form 28% of the population in this separate study.[139] In 2022, the same organization reported 61% was Christian (39% Protestant, 19% Catholic, 2% Mormon, 1% Eastern Orthodox), 2% New Age, 1% Jewish, 1% Hindu, and 34% religiously unaffiliated.\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest Christian denominations by the number of adherents in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 811,630; multi-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 229,981; and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 151,433.[140] In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives determined the largest Christian denominations were Catholics (873,236), non/multi/inter-denominational Protestants (406,798), and Mormons (150,509).[141] Throughout its non-Christian population, there were 12,500 Hindus, 7,101 Hindu Yogis, and 17,369 Buddhists at the 2020 study.\nOur Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church was the first permanent Catholic parish in modern-day Colorado and was constructed by Spanish colonists from New Mexico in modern-day Conejos.[142] Latin Church Catholics are served by three dioceses: the Archdiocese of Denver and the Dioceses of Colorado Springs and Pueblo.\nThe first permanent settlement by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Colorado arrived from Mississippi and initially camped along the Arkansas River just east of the present-day site of Pueblo.[143]\n\nHealth[edit]\nColorado is generally considered among the healthiest states by behavioral and healthcare researchers. Among the positive contributing factors is the state\'s well-known outdoor recreation opportunities and initiatives.[144] However, there is a stratification of health metrics with wealthier counties such as Douglas and Pitkin performing significantly better relative to southern, less wealthy counties such as Huerfano and Las Animas.[145]\n\nObesity[edit]\nAccording to several studies, Coloradans have the lowest rates of obesity of any state in the US.[146] As of 2018[update], 24% of the population was considered medically obese, and while the lowest in the nation, the percentage had increased from 17% in 2004.[147][148]\n\nLife expectancy[edit]\nAccording to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, residents of Colorado had a 2014 life expectancy of 80.21 years, the longest of any U.S. state.[149]\n\nHomelessness[edit]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 10,397 homeless people in Colorado.[150][151]\n\nEconomy[edit]\nMain article: Economy of Colorado\nDenver Energy Center lies in the Denver financial district along 17th Street, known as the \"Wall Street of the West\"\nCorn growing in Larimer County\nIn 2019 the total employment was 2,473,192. The number of employer establishments is 174,258.[152]\nThe total state product in 2015 was $318.6 billion.[153] Median Annual Household Income in 2016 was $70,666, 8th in the nation.[154] Per capita personal income in 2010 was $51,940, ranking Colorado 11th in the nation.[155] The state\'s economy broadened from its mid-19th-century roots in mining when irrigated agriculture developed, and by the late 19th century, raising livestock had become important. Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are cattle, wheat, dairy products, corn, and hay.\nThe federal government operates several federal facilities in the state, including NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command), United States Air Force Academy, Schriever Air Force Base located approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Peterson Air Force Base, and Fort Carson, both located in Colorado Springs within El Paso County; NOAA, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder; U.S. Geological Survey and other government agencies at the Denver Federal Center near Lakewood; the Denver Mint, Buckley Space Force Base, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Denver; and a federal Supermax Prison and other federal prisons near CaÃ±on City. In addition to these and other federal agencies, Colorado has abundant National Forest land and four National Parks that contribute to federal ownership of 24,615,788 acres (99,617 km2) of land in Colorado, or 37% of the total area of the state.[156]\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the industrial and service sectors expanded greatly. The state\'s economy is diversified and is notable for its concentration on scientific research and high-technology industries. Other industries include food processing, transportation equipment, machinery, chemical products, the extraction of metals such as gold (see Gold mining in Colorado), silver, and molybdenum. Colorado now also has the largest annual production of beer in any state.[157] Denver is an important financial center.\nThe state\'s diverse geography and majestic mountains attract millions of tourists every year, including 85.2 million in 2018. Tourism contributes greatly to Colorado\'s economy, with tourists generating $22.3 billion in 2018.[158]\nSeveral nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From Denver came the forerunner of telecommunications giant Qwest in 1879, Samsonite luggage in 1910, Gates belts and hoses in 1911, and Russell Stover Candies in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in Brighton in 1864. From Golden came Coors beer in 1873, CoorsTek industrial ceramics in 1920, and Jolly Rancher candy in 1949. CF&I railroad rails, wire, nails, and pipe debuted in Pueblo in 1892. Holly Sugar was first milled from beets in Holly in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day Swift packed meat of Greeley evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. Estes model rockets were launched in Penrose in 1958. Fort Collins has been the home of Woodward Governor Company\'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and Waterpik dental water jets and showerheads since 1962. Celestial Seasonings herbal teas have been made in Boulder since 1969. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory made its first candy in Durango in 1981.\nColorado has a flat 4.63% income tax, regardless of income level. On 3 November 2020 voters authorized an initiative to lower that income tax rate to 4.55 percent. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal adjusted gross income, Colorado taxes are based on taxable incomeâ€”income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.[159][160] Colorado\'s state sales tax is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, according to Colorado\'s Taxpayer Bill of Rights legislation, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates, in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.\nReal estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state\'s senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break was scheduled to return for the assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.\nAs of December 2018[update], the state\'s unemployment rate was 4.2%.[161]\nThe West Virginia teachers\' strike in 2018 inspired teachers in other states, including Colorado, to take similar action.[162]\n\nAgriculture[edit]\nCorn is grown in the Eastern Plains of Colorado. Arid conditions and drought negatively impacted yields in 2020[163] and 2022.[164]\n\nNatural resources[edit]\nAn oil well in western Colorado\nColorado has significant hydrocarbon resources. According to the Energy Information Administration, Colorado hosts seven of the largest natural gas fields in the United States, and two of the largest oil fields. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically accounts for more than five percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado\'s oil shale deposits hold an estimated 1 trillion barrels (160 km3) of oilâ€”nearly as much oil as the entire world\'s proven oil reserves.[165] Substantial deposits of bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite coal are found in the state.\nUranium mining in Colorado goes back to 1872, when pitchblende ore was taken from gold mines near Central City, Colorado. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico. When Colorado and Utah dominated radium mining from 1910 to 1922, uranium and vanadium were the byproducts (giving towns like present-day Superfund site Uravan their names).[166] Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted several companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. During the 1940s certain communitiesâ€“including Naturita and Paradoxâ€“earned the moniker of \"yellowcake towns\" from their relationship with uranium mining. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back the uranium-mining project. As of 2016, there were no major uranium mining operations in the state, though plans existed to restart production.[167]\n\nElectricity generation[edit]\nSee also: List of power stations in Colorado\nColorado\'s high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer wind power potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides the potential for geothermal power development. Much of the state is sunny and could produce solar power. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer hydroelectric power resources.\n\nCulture[edit]\nHistory Colorado Center in Denver\nStreet art in Denver\nArts and film[edit]\nList of museums in Colorado\nList of theaters in Colorado\nMusic of Colorado\nSeveral film productions have been shot on location in Colorado, especially prominent Westerns like True Grit, The Searchers, City Slickers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and My Life With the Walter Boys. Several historic military forts, railways with trains still operating, and mining ghost towns have been used and transformed for historical accuracy in well-known films. There are also several scenic highways and mountain passes that helped to feature the open road in films such as Vanishing Point, Bingo and Starman. Some Colorado landmarks have been featured in films, such as The Stanley Hotel in Dumb and Dumber and The Shining and the Sculptured House in Sleeper. In 2015, Furious 7 was to film driving sequences on Pikes Peak Highway in Colorado. The TV adult-animated series South Park takes place in central Colorado in the titular town. Additionally, The TV series Good Luck Charlie was set, but not filmed, in Denver, Colorado.[168] The Colorado Office of Film and Television has noted that more than 400 films have been shot in Colorado.[169]\nThere are also several established film festivals in Colorado, including Aspen Shortsfest, Boulder International Film Festival, Castle Rock Film Festival, Denver Film Festival, Festivus Film Festival, Mile High Horror Film Festival, Moondance International Film Festival, Mountainfilm in Telluride, Rocky Mountain Women\'s Film Festival, and Telluride Film Festival.\nMany notable writers have lived or spent extended periods in Colorado. Beat Generation writers Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady lived in and around Denver for several years each.[170] Irish playwright Oscar Wilde visited Colorado on his tour of the United States in 1882, writing in his 1906 Impressions of America that Leadville was \"the richest city in the world.  It has also got the reputation of being the roughest, and every man carries a revolver.\"[171][172]\n\nCuisine[edit]\nColorado is known for its Southwest and Rocky Mountain cuisine, with Mexican restaurants found throughout the state.\nBoulder was named America\'s Foodiest Town 2010 by Bon AppÃ©tit.[173] Boulder, and Colorado in general, is home to several national food and beverage companies, top-tier restaurants and farmers\' markets. Boulder also has more Master Sommeliers per capita than any other city, including San Francisco and New York.[174] Denver is known for steak, but now has a diverse culinary scene with many restaurants.[175]\nPolidori Sausage is a brand of pork products available in supermarkets, which originated in Colorado, in the early 20th century.[176]\nThe Food & Wine Classic is held annually each June in Aspen. Aspen also has a reputation as the culinary capital of the Rocky Mountain region.[177]\n\nWine and beer[edit]\nMain articles: Colorado wine and Colorado beer\nColorado wines include award-winning varietals that have attracted favorable notice from outside the state.[178] With wines made from traditional Vitis vinifera grapes along with wines made from cherries, peaches, plums, and honey, Colorado wines have won top national and international awards for their quality.[179] Colorado\'s grape growing regions contain the highest elevation vineyards in the United States,[180] with most viticulture in the state practiced between 4,000 and 7,000 feet (1,219 and 2,134 m) above sea level. The mountain climate ensures warm summer days and cool nights. Colorado is home to two designated American Viticultural Areas of the Grand Valley AVA and the West Elks AVA,[181] where most of the vineyards in the state are located. However, an increasing number of wineries are located along the Front Range.[182] In 2018, Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Colorado\'s Grand Valley AVA in Mesa County, Colorado, as one of the Top Ten wine travel destinations in the world.[183]\nColorado is home to many nationally praised microbreweries,[184] including New Belgium Brewing Company, Odell Brewing Company, Great Divide Brewing Company, and Bristol Brewing Company. The area of northern Colorado near and between the cities of Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins is known as the \"Napa Valley of Beer\" due to its high density of craft breweries.[185]\n\nMarijuana and hemp[edit]\nColorado is open to cannabis (marijuana) tourism.[186] With the adoption of the 64th state amendment in 2012, Colorado became the first state in the union to legalize marijuana for medicinal (2000), industrial (referring to hemp, 2012), and recreational (2012) use. Colorado\'s marijuana industry sold $1.31 billion worth of marijuana in 2016 and $1.26 billion in the first three-quarters of 2017.[187] The state generated tax, fee, and license revenue of $194 million in 2016 on legal marijuana sales.[188] Colorado regulates hemp as any part of the plant with less than 0.3% THC.[189]\nOn April 4, 2014, Senate Bill 14â€“184 addressing oversight of Colorado\'s industrial hemp program was first introduced, ultimately being signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper on May 31, 2014.[190]\n\nMedicinal use[edit]\nOn November 7, 2000, 54% of Colorado voters passed Amendment 20, which amends the Colorado State constitution to allow the medical use of marijuana.[191] A patient\'s medical use of marijuana, within the following limits, is lawful:\n\n(I) No more than 2 ounces (57 g) of a usable form of marijuana; and\n(II) No more than twelve marijuana plants, with six or fewer being mature, flowering plants that are producing a usable form of marijuana.[192]\nCurrently, Colorado has listed \"eight medical conditions for which patients can use marijuanaâ€”cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, muscle spasms, seizures, severe pain, severe nausea and cachexia, or dramatic weight loss and muscle atrophy\".[193] While governor, John Hickenlooper allocated about half of the state\'s $13 million \"Medical Marijuana Program Cash Fund\"[194] to medical research in the 2014 budget.[195] By 2018, the Medical Marijuana Program Cash Fund was the \"largest pool of pot money in the state\" and was used to fund programs including research into pediatric applications for controlling autism symptoms.[196]\n\nRecreational use[edit]\nOn November 6, 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect \"personal use\" of marijuana for adults, establishing a framework to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol.[197] The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.[198]\n\nSports[edit]\nMain article: Sports in Colorado\nThe Colorado Rockies baseball club at Coors Field\nEmpower Field at Mile High in Denver, home field of the Denver Broncos and the Denver Outlaws\nBall Arena, home of the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Mammoth\nDick\'s Sporting Goods Park, home of the Colorado Rapids\nColorado has five major professional sports leagues, all based in the Denver metropolitan area.

Interstate 25 (I-25) is the primary northâ€“south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. I-70 is the primary eastâ€“west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Many smaller communities are connected to this network only via county roads.\n\nThe main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the Front Range.\nDenver International Airport (DIA) is the third-busiest domestic U.S. and international airport in the world by passenger traffic.[201] DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.\nPublic transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-cityâ€”including the Denver metro area\'s RTD services. The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates the popular RTD Bus & Rail transit system in the Denver Metropolitan Area. As of January 2013[update] the RTD rail system had 170 light-rail vehicles, serving 47 miles (76 km) of track. In addition to local public transit, intercity bus service is provided by Burlington Trailways, Bustang, Express Arrow, and Greyhound Lines.\n\nThe westbound and eastbound California Zephyrs meet in the Glenwood Canyon.\nAmtrak operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the California Zephyr and Southwest Chief. Colorado\'s contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the \"Rio Grande\" was acquired, but was merged into, the Southern Pacific Railroad by their joint owner Philip Anschutz. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the Union Pacific Railroad, creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific\'s principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\nColorado\'s freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.[202]\nIn August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to aliens not lawfully in the United States who lived in Colorado.[203] In September 2014, KCNC reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.[204]\n\nEducation[edit]\nMain article: List of colleges and universities in Colorado\nSee also: Table of Colorado school districts, Table of Colorado charter schools, and Auraria Campus\nThe first institution of higher education in the Colorado Territory was the Colorado Seminary, opened on November 16, 1864, by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The seminary closed in 1867 but reopened in 1880 as the University of Denver. In 1870, the Bishop George Maxwell Randall of the Episcopal Church\'s Missionary District of Colorado and Parts Adjacent opened the first of what become the Colorado University Schools which would include the Territorial School of Mines opened in 1873 and sold to the Colorado Territory in 1874. These schools were initially run by the Episcopal Church.[205] An 1861 territorial act called for the creation of a public university in Boulder, though it would not be until 1876 that the University of Colorado was founded.[206] The 1876 act also renamed Territorial School of Mines as the Colorado School of Mines.[207] An 1870 territorial act created the Agricultural College of Colorado which opened in 1879.[208] The college was renamed the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1935, and became Colorado State University in 1957.\nThe first Catholic college in Colorado was the Jesuit Sacred Heart College, which was founded in New Mexico in 1877, moved to Morrison in 1884, and to Denver in 1887. The college was renamed Regis College in 1921 and Regis University in 1991.[209] On April 1, 1924, armed students patrolled the campus after a burning cross was found, the climax of tensions between Regis College and the locally-powerful Ku Klux Klan.[210]\nFollowing a 1950 assessment by the Service Academy Board, it was determined that there was a need to supplement the U.S. Military and Naval Academies with a third school that would provide commissioned officers for the newly independent Air Force. On April 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a law that moved for the creation of a U.S. Air Force Academy.[211] Later that year, Colorado Springs was selected to host the new institution. From its establishment in 1955, until the construction of appropriate facilities in Colorado Springs was completed and opened in 1958, the Air Force Academy operated out of Lowry Air Force Base in Denver. With the opening of the Colorado Springs facility, the cadets moved to the new campus, though not in the full-kit march that some urban and campus legends suggest.[212] The first class of Space Force officers from the Air Force Academy commissioned on April 18, 2020.[213]\n\nMilitary installations[edit]\nFort Carson\nPeterson Space Force Base\nUnited States Air Force Academy\nThe major military installations in Colorado include:\n\nBuckley Space Force Base (1938â€“)\nAir Reserve Personnel Center (1953â€“)\nFort Carson (U.S. Army 1942â€“)\nPiÃ±on Canyon Maneuver Site (1983â€“)\nPeterson Space Force Base (1942â€“)\nCheyenne Mountain Space Force Station (1961â€“)\nPueblo Chemical Depot (U.S. Army 1942â€“)\nSchriever Space Force Base (1983â€“)\nUnited States Air Force Academy (1954â€“)\nFormer military posts in Colorado include:\n\nSpanish Fort (Spanish Army 1819â€“1821)\nFort Massachusetts (U.S. Army 1852â€“1858)\nFort Garland (U.S. Army 1858â€“1883)\nCamp Collins (U.S. Army 1862â€“1870)\nFort Logan (U.S. Army 1887â€“1946)\nColorado National Guard Armory (1913â€“1933)\nFitzsimons Army Hospital (U.S. Army 1918â€“1999)\nDenver Medical Depot (U.S. Army 1925â€“1949)[214]\nLowry Air Force Base (1938â€“1994)\nPueblo Army Air Base (1941â€“1948)\nRocky Mountain Arsenal (U.S. Army 1942â€“1992)\nCamp Hale (U.S. Army 1942â€“1945)\nLa Junta Army Air Field (1942â€“1946)\nLeadville Army Air Field (1943â€“1944)\n\nGovernment[edit]\nMain article: Government of Colorado\nState government[edit]\n\n\nState Executive Officers\n\n\nOffice\n\nName\n\nParty\n\n\nGovernor\n\nJared Polis\n\nDemocratic\n\n\nLieutenant Governor\n\nDianne Primavera\n\nDemocratic\n\n\nSecretary of State\n\nJena Griswold\n\nDemocratic\n\n\nAttorney General\n\nPhil Weiser\n\nDemocratic\n\n\nTreasurer\n\nDave Young\n\nDemocratic\n\nLike the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado\'s state constitution provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.\nThe Governor of Colorado heads the state\'s executive branch. The current governor is Jared Polis, a Democrat. Colorado\'s other statewide elected executive officers are the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado (elected on a ticket with the Governor), Secretary of State of Colorado, Colorado State Treasurer, and Attorney General of Colorado, all of whom serve four-year terms.\nThe seven-member Colorado Supreme Court is the state\'s highest court, with seven justices. The Colorado Court of Appeals, with 22 judges, sits in divisions of three judges each. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state also has specialized water courts, which sit in seven distinct divisions around the state and which decide matters relating to water rights and the use and administration of water.\nThe state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses â€“ the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. As of 2023[update], the Democratic Party holds a 23 to 12 majority in the Senate and a 46 to 19 majority in the House.\nMost Coloradans are native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),[215] and this is illustrated by the fact that the state did not have a native-born governor from 1975 (when John David Vanderhoof left office) until 2007, when Bill Ritter took office; his election the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a native-born Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when John Arthur Love was given a position in Richard Nixon\'s administration in 1973).\nTax is collected by the Colorado Department of Revenue.\n\nPolitics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Colorado\nSee also: Political party strength in Colorado and United States presidential elections in Colorado\n\n\nColorado registered voters as of July 2, 2023[update][216]\n\n\nParty\n\nNumber of voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nUnaffiliated\n\n1,812,690\n\n46.88%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n1,052,739\n\n27.23%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n931,102\n\n24.08%\n\n\n\n\nLibertarian\n\n39,800\n\n1.03%\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Constitution\n\n11,738\n\n0.30%\n\n\n\n\nGreen\n\n8,513\n\n0.22%\n\n\n\n\nApproval Voting\n\n4,653\n\n0.12%\n\n\n\n\nUnity\n\n3,230\n\n0.08%\n\n\n\n\nNo Labels\n\n1,341\n\n0.03%\n\n\n\n\nCenter\n\n922\n\n0.02%\n\n\nTotal\n\n3,866,728\n\n100.00%\n\nColorado was once considered a swing state, but has become a relatively safe blue state in both state and federal elections.

Coloradans have elected 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans to the governorship in the last 100 years.\nIn presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state in the 1990s. Since the mid-2000s, it has swung heavily to the Democrats, voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020.\nColorado politics exhibits a contrast between conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and Grand Junction, and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in metropolitan Denver, the college towns of Fort Collins and Boulder, southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and several western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.\nColorado is represented by two members of the United States Senate:\n\nClass 2, John Hickenlooper (Democratic), since 2021\nClass 3, Michael Bennet (Democratic), since 2009\nColorado is represented by eight members of the United States House of Representatives:\n\n1st district: Diana DeGette (Democratic), since 1997\n2nd district: Joe Neguse (Democratic), since 2019\n3rd district: Lauren Boebert (Republican), since 2021\n4th district: Ken Buck (Republican), since 2015\n5th district: Doug Lamborn (Republican), since 2007\n6th district: Jason Crow (Democratic), since 2019\n7th district: Brittany Pettersen (Democratic), since 2023\n8th district: Yadira Caraveo (Democratic), since 2023\nIn a 2020 study, Colorado was ranked as the seventh easiest state for citizens to vote in.[217]\n\nSignificant initiatives and legislation enacted in Colorado[edit]\nColorado was the first state in the union to enact, by voter referendum, a law extending suffrage to women. That initiative was approved by the state\'s voters on November 7, 1893.[218]\nOn the November 8, 1932, ballot, Colorado approved the repeal of alcohol prohibition more than a year before the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified.\nColorado has banned, via C.R.S. section 12-6-302, the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday since at least 1953.[219]\nIn 1972 Colorado voters rejected a referendum proposal to fund the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had been scheduled to be held in the state. Denver had been chosen by the International Olympic Committee as the host city on May 12, 1970.[220]\nIn 1992, by a margin of 53 to 47 percent, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive or judicial action to recognize homosexuals or bisexuals as a protected class.[221] In 1996, in a 6â€“3 ruling in Romer v. Evans, the U.S. Supreme Court found that preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause.[222]\nIn 2006, voters passed Amendment 43, which banned gay marriage in Colorado.[223] That initiative was nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court\'s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.\nIn 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting the \"personal use\" of marijuana for adults, establishing a framework to regulate cannabis like alcohol. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.[198]\nOn December 19, 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump was disqualified from the 2024 United States presidential election in part due to his alleged incitement of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[224]\n\nNative American reservations[edit]\nThe two Native American reservations remaining in Colorado are the Southern Ute Indian Reservation (1873; Ute dialect: Kapuuta-wa Moghwachi NÃºuchi-u) and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation (1940; Ute dialect: WÊ‰gama NÃºuchi). The two abolished Indian reservations in Colorado were the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation (1851â€“1870) and Ute Indian Reservation (1855â€“1873).\n\n\nProtected areas[edit]\nMain article: List of protected areas of Colorado\nColorado is home to 4 national parks, 9 national monuments, 3 national historic sites, 2 national recreation areas, 4 national historic trails, 1 national scenic trail, 11 national forests, 2 national grasslands, 44 national wildernesses, 3 national conservation areas, 8 national wildlife refuges, 3 national heritage areas, 26 national historic landmarks, 16 national natural landmarks, more than 1,500 National Register of Historic Places, 1 wild and scenic river, 42 state parks, 307 state wildlife areas, 93 state natural areas, 28 national recreation trails, 6 regional trails, and numerous other scenic, historic, and recreational areas.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nEnvironment portalGeography portalGovernment portalHistory portalUnited States portalColorado portal\nBibliography of Colorado\nGeography of Colorado\nHistory of Colorado\nIndex of Colorado-related articles\nList of Colorado-related lists\nList of ships named the USS Colorado\nOutline of Colorado\n\nFootnotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n\n^ The official Four Corners Monument is located at 36Â°59\'56.31608â€³N, 109Â°2\'42.62075\"W, 574 feet (175 m) southeast of the 37Â°N, 109Â°02â€²48â€³W location Congress originally designated.\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c United States Census Bureau estimates of county population as of July 1, 2023,[99]\n\n^ As a consolidated city and county, the City and County  of Denver is its own county seat.[100]\n\n^ Littleton, Colorado also  extends into Jefferson and Douglas counties.\n\n^ Aurora, Colorado also extends into  Adams and Douglas  counties.\n\n^ Brighton, Colorado also extends  into Weld County.\n\n^ Thornton, Colorado also extends  into Weld County.\n\n^ Highlands Ranch,  Colorado is a census-designated place.\n\n^ As a consolidated city and county, the  City and County of Broomfield is its own county seat.[100]\n\n^ Edwards, Colorado is a  census-designated place.\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c United States Census Bureau estimates of municipal population as of July 1, 2022[102]\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n^ Several Air Force teams participate in other conferences, or as independents, in sports that the MW does not sponsor:\nBoxing, a men-only sport that is not sanctioned by the NCAA, competes as an independent.\nFencing, a coeducational sport with men\'s and women\'s squads, also competes as an independent.\nMen\'s and women\'s gymnastics both compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.\nMen\'s ice hockey competes in Atlantic Hockey.\nMen\'s lacrosse competes in the ASUN Conference.\nRifle, which at Air Force is a coeducational sport, competes in the Patriot Rifle Conference.\nMen\'s soccer and women\'s swimming & diving compete in the Western Athletic Conference.\nMen\'s wrestling competes in the Big 12 Conference.\n\n^ Several Colorado teams participate in other conferences in sports that the Pac-12 does not sponsor:\nMen\'s and women\'s indoor track & field compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.\nSkiing, a coeducational sport with men\'s and women\'s squads, competes in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association.\n\n^ Several Denver teams participate in other conferences in sports that The Summit League does not sponsor:\nWomen\'s gymnastics competes in the Big 12 Conference.\nMen\'s ice hockey competes in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference.\nMen\'s and women\'s lacrosse compete in the Big East Conference.\nSkiing, a coeducational sport with men\'s and women\'s squads, competes in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association.\n\n^ Several Northern Colorado teams participate in other conferences in sports that the Big Sky does not sponsor:\nBaseball competes in the Summit League.\nWomen\'s swimming & diving competes in the Western Athletic Conference.\nMen\'s wrestling competes in the Big 12 Conference.\n\n^ Colorado College, otherwise an NCAA Division III member, has two Division I teams.

It borders Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. Connecticut lies between the major hubs of New York City and Boston along the Northeast corridor, where the New York metropolitan area, which includes six of Connecticutâ€™s seven largest cities, extends well into the southwestern part of the state. Connecticut is the third-smallest state by area after Rhode Island and Delaware, and the 29th most populous with slightly more than 3.6 million residents as of 2020,[11] ranking it fourth among the most densely populated U.S. states.\nThe state is named after the Connecticut River, the longest in New England which roughly bisects the state and drains into the Long Island Sound between the towns of Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The name of the river is in turn derived from anglicized spellings of Quinnetuket, a Mohegan-Pequot word for \"long tidal river\".[12] Before the arrival of the first European settlers, the region was inhabited by various Algonquian tribes. In 1633, the Dutch West India Company established a small, short-lived settlement called House of Hope in Hartford. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established by the English around the same time. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The three colonies merged in 1662 under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony.\nConnecticutâ€™s official nickname is the \"Constitution Stateâ€, referring to the Fundamental Orders adopted by the Connecticut Colony in 1639, now considered by some to be the first written constitution in Western history.[13] As one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution, Connecticut was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. In January 1788, it became the fifth state to ratify the United States Constitution.\nConnecticut is a developed and affluent state, performing well on the Human Development Index and on different metrics of income except for equality. It is home to a number of prestigious educational institutions, including Yale University in New Haven and other liberal arts colleges and private boarding schools in and around the â€œKnowledge Corridorâ€. Owning to its geography, Connecticut has maintained a strong maritime tradition; the United States Coast Guard Academy is located in New London by the Thames River. The state is also associated with the aerospace industry through the companies Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky Aircraft headquartered in East Hartford and Stratford, respectively. Historically a manufacturing center for arms, hardware, and timepieces,[14] Connecticut, as with the rest of the region, had transitioned into an economy based on the financial, insurance, and real estate sectors; many of the firms providing such services can be found concentrated in the state capital of Hartford and along the Gold Coast in Fairfield County.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Connecticut\nA map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies\nFirst people[edit]\nThe name Connecticut is derived from the Mohegan-Pequot word that has been translated as \"long tidal river\" and \"upon the long river\",[15] both referring to the Connecticut River. Evidence of human presence in the Connecticut region dates to as far back as 10,000 years ago. Stone tools were used for hunting, fishing, and woodworking.[16][17] Semi-nomadic in lifestyle, these peoples moved seasonally to take advantage of various resources in the area.[18][19] They shared languages based on Algonquian.[20] The Connecticut region was inhabited by multiple Native American tribes which can be grouped into the Nipmuc, the Sequin or \"River Indians\" (which included the Tunxis, Schaghticoke, Podunk, Wangunk, Hammonasset, and Quinnipiac), the Mattabesec or \"Wappinger Confederacy\" and the Pequot-Mohegan.[21] Some of these groups still reside in Connecticut, including the Mohegans, the Pequots, and the Paugusetts.[22]\n\nColonial period[edit]\nMain articles: New Netherland, Saybrook Colony, Connecticut Colony, New Haven Colony, New England Confederation, and Dominion of New England\nThe first European explorer in Connecticut was Dutchman Adriaen Block,[23] who explored the region in 1614. Dutch fur traders then sailed up the Connecticut River, which they called Versche Rivier (\"Fresh River\"), and built a fort at Dutch Point in Hartford that they named \"House of Hope\" (Dutch: Huis van Hoop).[24]\n\nOn April 26, 1935, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp commemorating the 300th anniversary of the initial settlement of the Connecticut colony.\nThe Connecticut Colony was originally a number of separate, smaller settlements at Windsor, Wethersfield, Saybrook, Hartford, and New Haven. The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.[25] John Winthrop the Younger of Massachusetts received a commission to create Saybrook Colony at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635.[26]\nThe main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. They were Puritans from Massachusetts Bay Colony led by Thomas Hooker, who established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford.[27] The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were adopted in January 1639, and have been described as the first constitutional document in America.[28]\nThe Quinnipiack Colony[29] was established by John Davenport, Theophilus Eaton, and others at New Haven in March 1638. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution called \"The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony\", signed on June 4, 1639.[30]\nThe settlements were established without official sanction of the English Crown, and each was an independent political entity.[31] In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from Charles II which united the settlements of Connecticut.[32] Historically important colonial settlements included Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), Saybrook (1635), Hartford (1636), New Haven (1638), Fairfield (1639), Guilford (1639), Milford (1639), Stratford (1639), Farmington (1640), Stamford (1641), and New London (1646).\nThe Pequot War marked the first major clash between colonists and Native Americans in New England. The Pequots reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territoryâ€”while simultaneously taking lands from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on Block Island; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony\'s garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the Mystic River, with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in Fairfield, the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.[33]\nThe western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. The Hartford Treaty with the Dutch was signed on September 19, 1650, but it was never ratified by the British. According to it, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from Greenwich Bay for a distance of 20 miles (32 km),[34][35] \"provided the said line come not within 10 miles [16 km] of Hudson River\".[34][35] This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652. Conflict continued concerning colonial limits until the Duke of York captured New Netherland in 1664.[34][35]\nOn the other hand, Connecticut\'s original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the \"South Sea\"â€”that is, to the Pacific Ocean.[36] Most Colonial royal grants were for long eastâ€“west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously and established a ninth county between the Susquehanna River and Delaware River named Westmoreland County. This resulted in the brief Pennamite-Yankee Wars with Pennsylvania.[37]\nYale College was established in 1701, providing Connecticut with an important institution to educate clergy and civil leaders.[38] The Congregational church dominated religious life in the colony and, by extension, town affairs in many parts.[39]\nWith more than 600 miles (970 km) of coastline including along its navigable rivers,[40] Connecticut developed during its colonial years the antecedents of a maritime tradition that would later produce booms in shipbuilding, marine transport, naval support, seafood production, and leisure boating.\nHistorical records list the Tryall as the first vessel built in Connecticut Colony, in 1649 at a site on the Connecticut River in present-day Wethersfield.[41] In the two decades leading up to 1776 and the American Revolution, Connecticut boatyards launched about 100 sloops, schooners and brigs according to a database of U.S. customs records maintained online by the Mystic Seaport Museum, the largest being the 180-ton Patient Mary launched in New Haven in 1763.[42] Connecticut\'s first lighthouse was constructed in 1760 at the mouth of the Thames River with the New London Harbor Lighthouse.[43]\n\nAmerican Revolution[edit]\nMain article: American Revolutionary War\nA 1799 map of Connecticut which shows The Oblong, from Low\'s Encyclopaedia\nConnecticut designated four delegates to the Second Continental Congress who signed the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Huntington, Roger Sherman, William Williams, and Oliver Wolcott.[44] Connecticut\'s legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments in 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord. There were some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775.[45] In 1775, David Bushnell invented the Turtle which the following year launched the first submarine attack in history, unsuccessfully against a British warship at anchor in New York Harbor.[46]\nIn 1777, the British got word of Continental Army supplies in Danbury, and they landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in Westport. This force then marched to Danbury and destroyed homes and much of the depot. Continental Army troops and militia led by General David Wooster and General Benedict Arnold engaged them on their return march at Ridgefield in 1777.[47] For the winter of 1778â€“79, General George Washington decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling New York City, where British General Sir Henry Clinton had taken up winter quarters.[48] Major General Israel Putnam chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam\'s soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in Danbury and to support any operations along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River Valley.[49] Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures, and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment \"Connecticut\'s Valley Forge\".[50]\nThe state was also the launching site for a number of raids against Long Island orchestrated by Samuel Holden Parsons and Benjamin Tallmadge,[51] and provided soldiers and material for the war effort, especially to Washington\'s army outside New York City. General William Tryon raided the Connecticut coast in July 1779, focusing on New Haven, Norwalk, and Fairfield.[52] New London and Groton Heights were raided in September 1781 by Benedict Arnold, who had turned traitor to the British.[53]\nAt the outset of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress assigned Nathaniel Shaw Jr. of New London as its naval agent in charge of recruiting privateers to seize British vessels as opportunities presented, with nearly 50 operating out of the Thames River which eventually drew the reprisal from the British force led by Arnold.[54]\n\nEarly statehood[edit]\nEarly national period and industrial revolution[edit]\nConnecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.[55]\nThe state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade[56] and fisheries. After Congress established in 1790 the predecessor to the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service that would evolve into the U.S. Coast Guard, President Washington assigned Jonathan Maltbie as one of seven masters to enforce customs regulations, with Maltbie monitoring the southern New England coast with a 48-foot cutter sloop named Argus.[57]\nIn 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the Northwest Territory. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the Connecticut Western Reserve.[58] The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio.\nConnecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished the land claims within those states\' boundaries and created the Connecticut Panhandle. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,[58] which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts).\n\n19th century[edit]\nFor the first time in 1800, Connecticut shipwrights launched more than 100 vessels in a single year. Over the following decade to the doorstep of renewed hostilities with Britain that sparked the War of 1812, Connecticut boatyards constructed close to 1,000 vessels, the most productive stretch of any decade in the 19th century.[42]\nDuring the war, the British launched raids in Stonington and Essex and blockaded vessels in the Thames River. Derby native Isaac Hull became Connecticut\'s best-known naval figure to win renown during the conflict, as captain of the USS Constitution.\nThe British blockade during the War of 1812 hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.[59] The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery. Connecticut came to be recognized as a major center for manufacturing, due in part to the inventions of Eli Whitney and other early innovators of the Industrial Revolution.[60]\nThe war led to the development of fast clippers that helped extend the reach of New England merchants to the Pacific and Indian oceans. The first half of the 19th century saw as well a rapid rise in whaling, with New London emerging as one of the New England industry\'s three biggest home ports after Nantucket and New Bedford.[61]\nThe state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of Timothy Dwight. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and Noah Webster,[62] who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists. The failure of the Hartford Convention in 1814 hurt the Federalist cause, with the Democratic-Republican Party gaining control in 1817.[63]\nConnecticut had been governed under the \"Fundamental Orders\" since 1639, but the state adopted a new constitution in 1818.[64]\n\nCivil War era[edit]\nMain article: Connecticut in the American Civil War\nView of New London in 1854\nConnecticut manufacturers played a major role in supplying the Union forces with weapons and supplies during the Civil War. The state furnished 55,000 men, formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the U.S. Colored Troops, with several Connecticut men becoming generals. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 men, and Glastonbury native Gideon Welles was Secretary of the Navy. James H. Ward of Hartford was the first U.S. Naval Officer killed in the Civil War.[65] Connecticut casualties included 2,088 killed in combat, 2,801 dying from disease, and 689 dying in Confederate prison camps.[66][67][68]\nA surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.[69][70]\n\nSecond industrial revolution[edit]\n1895 map from Rand McNally\nConnecticut\'s extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839. By 1840, 102 miles (164 km) of line were in operation, growing to 402 miles (647 km) in 1850 and 601 miles (967 km) in 1860.[71]\nThe New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, called the New Haven or \"The Consolidated\", became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. J. P. Morgan began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of track with 120,000 employees.[72]\nAs steam-powered passenger ships proliferated after the Civil War, Noank would produce the two largest built in Connecticut during the 19th century, with the 332-foot wooden steam paddle wheeler Rhode Island launched in 1882, and the 345-foot paddle wheeler Connecticut seven years later. Connecticut shipyards would launch more than 165 steam-powered vessels in the 19th century.[42]\nIn 1875, the first telephone exchange in the world was established in New Haven.[73]\n\n20th century[edit]\nWorld War I[edit]\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut became a major supplier of weaponry to the U.S. military; by 1918, 80% of the state\'s industries were producing goods for the war effort.[74] Remington Arms in Bridgeport produced half the small-arms cartridges used by the U.S. Army,[75] with other major suppliers including Winchester in New Haven and Colt in Hartford.[76]\nConnecticut was also an important U.S. Navy supplier, with Electric Boat receiving orders for 85 submarines,[77] Lake Torpedo Boat building more than 20 subs,[78] and the Groton Iron Works building freighters.[79] On June 21, 1916, the Navy made Groton the site for its East Coast submarine base and school.\nThe state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918 with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.[80] Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury\'s American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.[81]\n\nInterwar period[edit]\nIn 1919, J. Henry Roraback started the Connecticut Light & Power Co.[82] which became the state\'s dominant electric utility. In 1925, Frederick Rentschler spurred the creation of Pratt & Whitney in Hartford to develop engines for aircraft; the company became an important military supplier in World War II and one of the three major manufacturers of jet engines in the world.[83]\nOn September 21, 1938, the most destructive storm in New England history struck eastern Connecticut, killing hundreds of people.[84] The eye of the \"Long Island Express\" passed just west of New Haven and devastated the Connecticut shoreline between Old Saybrook and Stonington from the full force of wind and waves, even though they had partial protection by Long Island. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. In New London, a 500-foot (150 m) sailing ship was driven into a warehouse complex, causing a major fire. Heavy rainfall caused the Connecticut River to flood downtown Hartford and East Hartford. An estimated 50,000 trees fell onto roadways.[85]\n\nWorld War II[edit]\nThe advent of lend-lease in support of Britain helped lift Connecticut from the Great Depression,[86] with the state a major production center for weaponry and supplies used in World War II. Connecticut manufactured 4.1% of total U.S. military armaments produced during the war, ranking ninth among the 48 states,[87] with major factories including Colt[88] for firearms, Pratt & Whitney for aircraft engines, Chance Vought for fighter planes, Hamilton Standard for propellers,[89] and Electric Boat for submarines and PT boats.[90] In Bridgeport, General Electric produced a significant new weapon to combat tanks: the bazooka.[91]\nOn May 13, 1940, Igor Sikorsky made an untethered flight of the first practical helicopter.[92] The helicopter saw limited use in World War II, but future military production made Sikorsky Aircraft\'s Stratford plant Connecticut\'s largest single manufacturing site by the start of the 21st century.[93]\n\nPost-World War II economic expansion[edit]\nConnecticut lost some wartime factories following the end of hostilities, but the state shared in a general post-war expansion that included the construction of highways[94] and resulting in middle-class growth in suburban areas.\nPrescott Bush represented Connecticut in the U.S. Senate from 1952 to 1963; his son George H. W. Bush and grandson George W. Bush both became presidents of the United States.[95] In 1965, Connecticut ratified its current constitution, replacing the document that had served since 1818.[96]\nIn 1968, commercial operation began for the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Haddam; in 1970, the Millstone Nuclear Power Station began operations in Waterford.[97] In 1974, Connecticut elected Democratic Governor Ella T. Grasso, who became the first woman in any state to be elected governor without being the wife or widow of a previous governor.[98]\n\nLate 20th century[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (October 2021)\nConnecticut\'s dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the Cold War. The resulting budget crisis helped elect Lowell Weicker as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker\'s remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in balancing the budget, but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.[99]\nIn 1992, initial construction was completed on Foxwoods Casino at the Mashantucket Pequots reservation in eastern Connecticut, which became the largest casino in the Western Hemisphere. Mohegan Sun followed four years later.[100]\n\nEarly 21st century[edit]\nIn 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate, marking the first time that a major party presidential ticket included someone of the Jewish faith.[101] Gore and Lieberman fell five votes short of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in the Electoral College. In the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 65 state residents were killed, mostly Fairfield County residents who were working in the World Trade Center.[102] In 2004, Republican Governor John G. Rowland resigned during a corruption investigation, later pleading guilty to federal charges.[103][104]\nConnecticut was hit by three major storms in just over 14 months in 2011 and 2012, with all three causing extensive property damage and electric outages. Hurricane Irene struck Connecticut August 28, and damage totaled $235 million.[105] Two months later, the \"Halloween nor\'easter\" dropped extensive snow onto trees, resulting in snapped branches and trunks that damaged power lines; some areas were without electricity for 11 days.[106] Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey and passed over Connecticut with hurricane-force winds and tides up to 12 feet above normal. Many coastal buildings were damaged or destroyed.[107] Sandy\'s winds drove storm surges into streets and cut power to 98% of homes and businesses, with more than $360 million in damage.[108]\nOn December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, and then killed himself.[109] The massacre spurred renewed efforts by activists for tighter laws on gun ownership nationally.[110]\nIn the summer and fall of 2016, Connecticut experienced a drought in many parts of the state, causing some water-use bans. As of November 15, 2016 (2016-11-15), 45% of the state was listed at Severe Drought by the U.S. Drought Monitor, including almost all of Hartford and Litchfield counties. All the rest of the state was in Moderate Drought or Severe Drought, including Middlesex, Fairfield, New London, New Haven, Windham, and Tolland counties. This affected the agricultural economy in the state.[111][112][113]\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geology of Connecticut\nFurther information: Geology of New England\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound, on the west by New York, on the north by Massachusetts, and on the east by Rhode Island. The state capital and fourth largest city is Hartford, and other major cities and towns (by population) include Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, Danbury, New Britain, Greenwich, and Bristol. There are 169 incorporated towns in Connecticut, with cities and villages included within some towns.[114]\n\nReference Map showing major highways and settlements\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42Â°3â€² N, 73Â°29â€² W), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.[115] At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6.1 m) above sea level.\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that historyâ€”yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on Long Island Sound, which is an estuary. The state\'s access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). Due to this unique geography, Long Island Sound and the Connecticut shoreline are relatively protected from high waves from storms.[116]\nThe Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the Connecticut River Valley. Despite Connecticut\'s relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern Litchfield Hills, it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal marshes, beaches, and large scale maritime activities.\nConnecticut\'s rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a green. Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of New England towns, such as a white church, a colonial meeting house, a colonial tavern or inn, several colonial houses, and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both historic preservation and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick\'s residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.[117][118]\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County and the Western Connecticut Planning Region, containing the towns of Greenwich, Stamford, New Canaan, Darien, and parts of Norwalk and Wilton. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to Rye, New York.[119]\nAreas maintained by the National Park Service include Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, and Weir Farm National Historic Site.[120]\n\nClimate[edit]\nFurther information: Climate change in Connecticut\nKÃ¶ppen climate types of Connecticut, using 1991â€“2020 climate normals.\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the humid continental climate, and the northern portion of the humid subtropical climate. Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix of rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower East Coast.\n\nPrecipitation[edit]\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months.[121] Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of sunshine annually.[122] On average, about one third of days in the state see some amount of precipitation each year.[121] Occasionally, some months may see extremes in precipitation, either much higher or lower than normal, though long term droughts and floods are rare.[121]\nEarly spring can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building Bermuda High creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state. Average highs are 81 Â°F (27 Â°C) in New London and 85 Â°F (29 Â°C) in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to 100 Â°F (38 Â°C) occur across Connecticut. Connecticut\'s record high temperature is 106 Â°F (41 Â°C) which occurred in Danbury on July 15, 1995.[123] Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.[124] During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare. Some notable hurricanes to impact the state include the 1938 New England hurricane, Hurricane Carol in 1954, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and Hurricane Isaias in 2020.[125][126]\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s Â°F for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from 38 Â°F (3 Â°C) in the coastal lowlands to 33 Â°F (1 Â°C) in the inland and northern portions on the state. The lowest temperature recorded in Connecticut is âˆ’32 Â°F (âˆ’36 Â°C) which has been observed twice: in Falls Village on February 16, 1943, and in Coventry on January 22, 1961.[123] The average yearly snowfall ranges from about 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only 20â€“25 inches (510â€“640 mm) along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of Interstate 84 receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\nDuring winter every few years, Connecticut can occasionally get heavy snowstorms, called nor\'easters, which may produce as much as two feet of snow on rare occasions.[121][127] Ice storms also occur on occasion, such as the Southern New England ice storm of 1973 and the December 2008 Northeastern United States ice storm. These storms can cause widespread power outages and damage.\n\n\n\nMonthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (Â°F)\n\n\nCity\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\n\nBridgeport\n\n38/24\n\n40/25\n\n47/32\n\n58/41\n\n68/51\n\n77/61\n\n83/67\n\n81/67\n\n75/59\n\n64/48\n\n53/38\n\n43/30\n\n\nHartford\n\n35/18\n\n38/20\n\n47/28\n\n60/38\n\n71/48\n\n79/57\n\n85/63\n\n83/61\n\n75/53\n\n63/42\n\n51/33\n\n40/24\n\n\n[128][129]\n\nFlora[edit]\nMain article: Flora of Connecticut\nSee also: List of Connecticut tree species\nForests consist of a mix of Northeastern coastal forests of oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland New England-Acadian forests in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is the state flower and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and Pachaug State Forest is home to the Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus (Opuntia humifusa), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.[130] Connecticut spans USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b to 7a. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where more southern and subtropical plants are cultivated. In some coastal communities, Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia), crape myrtles, scrub palms (Sabal minor), needle palms (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), and other broadleaved evergreens are cultivated in small numbers.[citation needed]\n\nLargest cities and towns[edit]\n\n\n\n\n   Largest cities or towns in Connecticut[131]\n\n\n\nRank\n\nName\n\nRegion\n\nPop.\n\n\n\n\nBridgeportStamford\n\n1\nBridgeport\nGreater Bridgeport\n148,654\n\nNew HavenHartford\n\n\n2\nStamford\nWestern\n135,470\n\n\n3\nNew Haven\nSouth Central\n134,023\n\n\n4\nHartford\nCapitol\n121,054\n\n\n5\nWaterbury\nNaugatuck Valley\n114,403\n\n\n6\nNorwalk\nWestern\n91,184\n\n\n7\nDanbury\nWestern\n86,518\n\n\n8\nNew Britain\nCapitol\n74,135\n\n\n9\nWest Hartford\nCapitol\n64,083\n\n\n10\nGreenwich\nWestern\n63,518\n\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%Â±\n1790237,946â€”1800251,0025.5%1810261,9424.4%1820275,2485.1%1830297,6758.1%1840309,9784.1%1850370,79219.6%1860460,14724.1%1870537,45416.8%1880622,70015.9%1890746,25819.8%1900908,42021.7%19101,114,75622.7%19201,380,63123.9%19301,606,90316.4%19401,709,2426.4%19502,007,28017.4%19602,535,23426.3%19703,031,70919.6%19803,107,5762.5%19903,287,1165.8%20003,405,5653.6%20103,574,0974.9%20203,605,9440.9%2023 (est.)3,617,1760.3%Sources:[132][133]\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, Connecticut has a population of 3,605,944, an increase of 31,847 people (0.9%) from the 2010 United States census.[134] Among the census records, 20.4% of the population was under 18.\nIn 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as \"rural\". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the Gold Coast) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state and has high property costs and high incomes. The center of population of Connecticut is located in the town of Cheshire.[135]\nAccording to HUD\'s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,930 homeless people in Connecticut.[136][137]\n\nEthnic origins in Connecticut\nConnecticut\'s population density map\n\nRacial and ethnic composition as of the 2020 census\nhide\n\nRace and ethnicity[138]\n\nAlone\n\nTotal\n\n\nWhite (non-Hispanic)\n\n63.2%\n\n63.2 \n\n66.6%\n\n66.6 \n\n\nHispanic or Latino[b]\n\nâ€”\n\n\n\n17.3%\n\n17.3 \n\n\nAfrican American (non-Hispanic)\n\n10.0%\n\n10 \n\n11.4%\n\n11.4 \n\n\nAsian\n\n4.7%\n\n4.7 \n\n5.5%\n\n5.5 \n\n\nNative American\n\n0.2%\n\n0.2 \n\n1.1%\n\n1.1 \n\n\nPacific Islander\n\n0.03%\n\n0.03 \n\n0.1%\n\n0.1 \n\n\nOther\n\n0.8%\n\n0.8 \n\n2.1%\n\n2.1 \n\n\nHistorical racial composition of Connecticut\nshow\n\nRacial composition\n1990\n[139] 2000\n[140] 2010[141]\n2020[142]\n\n\nWhite\n87.0%\n81.6%\n77.6%\n66.4%\n\n\nBlack\n8.3%\n9.1%\n10.1%\n10.8%\n\n\nAsian\n1.5%\n2.4%\n3.8%\n4.8%\n\n\nNative\n0.2%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.4%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander\nâ€“\nâ€“\nâ€“\n-\n\n\nOther race\n2.9%\n4.3%\n5.6%\n8.3%\n\n\nTwo or more races\nâ€“\n2.2%\n2.6%\n9.2%\n\nIn common with the majority of the United States, non-Hispanic whites have remained the dominant racial and ethnic group in Connecticut. From being 98% of the population in 1940, however, they have declined to 63% of the population as of the 2020 census.[134][143] These statistics have represented fewer Americans identifying as non-Hispanic white, which has given rise to the Hispanic and Latino American population and Asian American population overall.[144][145] As of 2011[update], 46.1% of Connecticut\'s population younger than age 1 were minorities.[146] As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born. In 1870, native-born Americans had accounted for 75% of the state\'s population, but that had dropped to 35% by 1918. Also as of 2000, 81.69% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older spoke English at home and 8.42% spoke Spanish, followed by Italian at 1.59%, French at 1.31%, and Polish at 1.20%.[147]\nThe largest ancestry groups since 2010 were:[148] 19.3% Italian, 17.9% Irish, 10.7% English, 10.4% German, 8.6% Polish, 6.6% French, 3.0% French Canadian, 2.7% American, 2.0% Scottish, and 1.4% Scotch Irish.\nThe top countries of origin for Connecticut\'s immigrants in 2018 were India, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Poland and Ecuador.[149]\n\nBirth data[edit]\nNote: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\n\nLive Births by Single Race/Ethnicity of Mother\nshow\n\nRace\n\n2013[150]\n\n2014[151]\n\n2015[152]\n\n2016[153]\n\n2017[154]\n\n2018[155]\n\n2019[156]\n\n2020[157]\n\n2021[158]\n\n2022[159]\n\n\nWhite:\n\n28,454 (78.8%)\n\n28,543 (78.7%)\n\n28,164 (78.8%)\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n> Non-Hispanic White\n\n20,704 (57.4%)\n\n20,933 (57.7%)\n\n20,395 (57.0%)\n\n19,551 (54.3%)\n\n18,842 (53.5%)\n\n18,488 (53.2%)\n\n18,366 (53.6%)\n\n17,785 (53.2%)\n\n19,136 (53.6%)\n\n18,681 (52.9%)\n\n\nBlack\n\n5,103 (14.1%)\n\n5,154 (14.2%)\n\n4,988 (14.0%)\n\n4,453 (12.4%)\n\n4,301 (12.2%)\n\n4,423 (12.7%)\n\n4,221 (12.3%)\n\n4,056 (12.1%)\n\n4,357 (12.2%)\n\n4,298 (12.2%)\n\n\nAsian\n\n2,221 (6.1%)\n\n2,280 (6.3%)\n\n2,497 (7.0%)\n\n2,583 (7.2%)\n\n2,475 (7.0%)\n\n2,232 (6.4%)\n\n2,199 (6.4%)\n\n1,992 (6.0%)\n\n1,921 (5.4%)\n\n1,878 (5.3%)\n\n\nAmerican Indian\n\n307 (0.9%)\n\n308 (0.8%)\n\n97 (0.3%)\n\n26 (0.1%)\n\n28 (0.1%)\n\n38 (0.1%)\n\n24 (0.1%)\n\n35 (0.1%)\n\n33 (0.1%)\n\n33 (0.1%)\n\n\nHispanic (of any race)\n\n8,208 (22.7%)\n\n8,129 (22.4%)\n\n8,275 (23.1%)\n\n8,622 (23.9%)\n\n8,833 (25.1%)\n\n8,762 (25.2%)\n\n8,728 (25.5%)\n\n8,861 (26.5%)\n\n9,482 (26.6%)\n\n9,597 (27.2%)\n\n\nTotal Connecticut \n\n36,085 (100%)\n\n36,285 (100%)\n\n35,746 (100%)\n\n36,015 (100%)\n\n35,221 (100%)\n\n34,725 (100%)\n\n34,258 (100%)\n\n33,460 (100%)\n\n35,670 (100%)\n\n35,332 (100%)\n\n\n\nReligion in Connecticut (2014)[160]\n\nReligion\n\nPercent\n\n\nProtestant\nâ€‰\n35%\n\n\nCatholic\nâ€‰\n33%\n\n\nNone\nâ€‰\n28%\n\n\nJewish\nâ€‰\n3%\n\n\nMormon\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nEastern Orthodox\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nOther Christian\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nBuddhist\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nHindu\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nMuslim\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\nOther\nâ€‰\n2%\n\n\nDo not know\nâ€‰\n1%\n\n\n\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\nReligion[edit]\nA Pew survey of Connecticut residents\' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations in 2014:[160] Protestant 35%, Mormonism 1%, Jewish 3%, Roman Catholic 33%, Orthodox 1%, Non-religious 28%, Jehovah\'s Witness 1%, Hinduism 1%, Buddhism 1% and Islam 1%.[160][161] Jewish congregations had 108,280 (3.2%) members in 2000.[162]\nThe Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between Greenwich and New Haven, in Greater New Haven and in Greater Hartford, especially the suburb of West Hartford. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2010 were: the Catholic Church, with 1,252,936; the United Church of Christ, with 96,506; and non-denominational Evangelical Protestants, with 72,863.[162]\nRecent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low. Connecticut is also home to New England\'s largest Protestant church: The First Cathedral in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford, which is sovereign over the Diocese of Bridgeport and the Diocese of Norwich.\nBy the Public Religion Research Institute\'s study in 2020, 71% of the population identified as Christian.[163] In contrast to the 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the irreligious declined from 28% of the population to 21% at the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute\'s study.\n\nEconomy[edit]\nSee also: Economy of Connecticut and List of Connecticut locations by per capita income\nA welcome sign on I-91 in Enfield.\nConnecticut\'s economic output in 2019 as measured by gross domestic product was $289 billion, up from $277.9 billion in 2018.[164]\nConnecticut\'s per capita personal income in 2019 was estimated at $79,087, the highest of any state.[165] There is, however, a great disparity in incomes throughout the state; after New York, Connecticut had the second largest gap nationwide between the average incomes of the top 1% and the average incomes of the bottom 99%.[166] According to a 2018 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Connecticut had the third-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 7.75%.[167] New Canaan is the wealthiest town in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $85,459. Hartford is the poorest municipality in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $13,428 in 2000.[168]\nAs of December 2019, Connecticut\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8%, with U.S. unemployment at 3.5% that month. Dating back to 1982, Connecticut recorded its lowest unemployment in 2000 between August and October, at 2.2%. The highest unemployment rate during that period occurred in November and December 2010 at 9.3%,[169] but economists expected record new levels of layoffs as a result of business closures in the spring of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.[170]\n\nTaxation[edit]\nTax is collected by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services[171] and by local municipalities.[172]\nAs of 2012, Connecticut residents had the second highest rate in the nation of combined state and local taxes after New York, at 12.6% of income compared to the national average of 9.9% as reported by the Tax Foundation.[173]\nBefore 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only income tax system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.\nIn 1991, under Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; as of 2019[update], Fairfield County was home to the headquarters for 16 of the 200 largest hedge funds in the world.[174]\nAs of 2019[update], the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals were divided into seven tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000â€“$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000â€“$100,000); 6% ($100,000â€“$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000â€“$250,000); 6.9% ($250,000â€“$500,000); and 6.99% above $500,000, with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.[175]\nAll wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state\'s income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction.[176] Since New York has higher income tax rates than Connecticut,[177] this effectively means that Connecticut residents who work in New York have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.[176]\nConnecticut levies a 6.35% state sales tax on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.[178] Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by statute. A provision excluding clothing under $50 from sales tax was repealed as of July 1, 2011[update].[178] There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions. In 2001, Connecticut instituted what became an annual sales tax \"holiday\" each August lasting one week, when retailers do not have to remit sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing that has varied from year to year.[179]\nState law authorizes municipalities to tax property, including real estate, vehicles and other personal property, with state statute providing varying exemptions, credits and abatements. All assessments are at 70% of fair market value.[172] The maximum property tax credit is $200 per return[180] and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward.[181] According to the Tax Foundation, on a per capita basis in the 2017 fiscal year Connecticut residents paid the 3rd highest average property taxes in the nation after New Hampshire and New Jersey.[182]\nAs of January 1, 2020[update], gasoline taxes and fees in Connecticut were 40.13 cents per gallon, 11th highest in the United States which had a nationwide average of 36.13 cents a gallon excluding federal taxes. Diesel taxes and fees as of January 2020 in Connecticut were 46.50 cents per gallon, ninth highest nationally with the U.S. average at 37.91 cents.[183]\n\nReal estate[edit]\nIn 2019, sales of single-family homes in Connecticut totaled 33,146 units, a 2.1 percent decline from the 2018 transaction total. The median home sold in 2019 recorded a transaction amount of $260,000, up 0.4 percent from 2018.[184]\nConnecticut had the seventh highest rate of home foreclosure activity in the country in 2019 at 0.53 percent of the total housing stock.[185]\n\nIndustries[edit]\nSee also: List of Connecticut companies\nFinance, insurance and real estate was Connecticut\'s largest industry in 2018 as ranked by gross domestic product, generating $75.7 billion in GDP that year.[186] Major employers include The Hartford, Travelers, Harman International, Cigna, the Aetna subsidiary of CVS Health, Mass Mutual, People\'s United Financial, Bank of America, Realogy,[187] Bridgewater Associates,[188] GE Capital,[189] William Raveis Real Estate,[190] and Berkshire Hathaway through reinsurance and residential real estate subsidiaries.\nThe combined educational, health and social services sector was the largest single industry as ranked by employment, with a combined workforce of 342,600 people at the end of 2019,[191] ranking fourth the year before in GDP at $28.3 billion.\nThe broad business and professional services sector had the second highest GDP total in Connecticut in 2018 at an estimated $33.7 billion.[186]\nManufacturing was the third biggest industry in 2018 with GDP of $30.8 billion,[186] dominated by Raytheon Technologies formed in the March 2020 merger of Hartford-based United Technologies and Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon Co. As of the merger, Raytheon Technologies employed about 19,000 people in Connecticut through subsidiaries Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.[192] Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft operates Connecticut\'s single largest manufacturing plant in Stratford,[190] where it makes helicopters.\nThe world\'s largest audio equipment manufacturing company Harman International is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.[citation needed] It owns many brands like JBL, Akg and Harman kardon.[193]\nOther major manufacturers include the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, which makes submarines in Groton,[194] Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer with its U.S. headquarters in Ridgefield,[190] and ASML, which in Wilton makes precision lithography machines used to create circuitry on semiconductors and flat-screen displays.[195]\nConnecticut historically was a center of gun manufacturing, and four gun-manufacturing firms continued to operate in the state as of December 2012[update], employing 2,000 people: Colt, Stag, Ruger, and Mossberg.[196] Marlin, owned by Remington, closed in April 2011.[197]\nOther large components of the Connecticut economy in 2018 included wholesale trade ($18.1 billion in GDP); information services ($13.8 billion); retail ($13.7 billion); arts, entertainment and food services ($9.1 billion); and construction ($8.3 billion).[186]\nTourists spent $9.3 billion in Connecticut in 2017 according to estimates as part of a series of studies commissioned by the state of Connecticut.[198] Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are the two biggest tourist draws and number among the state\'s largest employers;[199] both are located on Native American reservations in the southeastern Connecticut.\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Connecticut\nConnecticut\'s agricultural production totaled $580 million in 2017, with just over half of that revenue the result of nursery stock production. Milk production totaled $81 million that year, with other major product categories including eggs, vegetables and fruit, tobacco and shellfish.[200]\n\nEnergy[edit]\nSee also: List of power stations in Connecticut\nConnecticut\'s economy uses less energy to produce each dollar of GDP than all other states except California, Massachusetts, and New York. It uses less energy on a per-capita basis than all but six other states. It has no fossil-fuel resources, but does have renewable resources. Average retail electricity prices are the highest among the 48 contiguous states. While most of the state\'s energy consumption is generated using fossil fuels, nuclear power delivered over 40% of state\'s electricity generation in 2019. Refuse-derived fuels and other biomass provided the largest share of renewable electricity at about a 3% share. Solar and wind generation have grown in recent years. More than three-quarters of solar generation came from distributed small-scale installations such as rooftop solar in 2019, and there is planning underway to significantly increase renewable generation with the state\'s offshore wind resource.[201]\n\nTransport[edit]\nMain article: Transportation in Connecticut\nRoads[edit]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of State Routes in Connecticut.\nThe Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Q Bridge, carries ten lanes over the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, along the Connecticut Turnpike.\nThe Interstate highways in the state are Interstate 95 (I-95) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, I-84 traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, I-91 traveling north to south in the center of the state, and I-395 traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway, which together form Connecticut Route 15 (Route 15), traveling from the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York parallel to I-95 before turning north of New Haven and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in Berlin. I-95 and Route 15 were originally toll roads; they relied on a system of toll plazas at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of major crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.[202] Other major arteries in the state include U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, Route 8 farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling northâ€“south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US 7, and Route 9 in the east.\nBetween New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only three lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy rush hour delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and ride-sharing.[203]\nConnecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States, particularly in New Haven. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.[204]\n\nRail[edit]\nA Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line train leaving Stamford Station\nRail is a popular travel mode between New Haven and New York City\'s Grand Central Terminal. Southwestern Connecticut is served by the Metro-North Railroad\'s New Haven Line, operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Metro-North provides commuter service between New York City and New Haven, with branches to New Canaan, Danbury, and Waterbury. Connecticut lies along Amtrak\'s Northeast Corridor, which features frequent Northeast Regional and Acela Express service from New Haven south to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA, as well as north to New London, Providence and Boston. Since 1990, coastal cities and towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the Shore Line East commuter line.[205]\nIn June 2018, a commuter rail service called the Hartford Line began operating between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak\'s New Haven-Springfield Line.[206] Hartford Line service is provided by both Amtrak and the Connecticut Department of Transportation\'s CT Rail, and in addition to its termini serves New Haven State Street, Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, Hartford, Windsor, and Windsor Locks. Several infill stations are planned to be added in the near future as of 2021. Amtrak\'s Vermonter runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line. In July 2019, Amtrak launched the Valley Flyer, which runs between New Haven and Greenfield, Massachusetts.[207]\nA proposed commuter rail service, the Central Corridor Rail Line, would connect New London with Norwich, Willimantic, Storrs, and Stafford Springs, with service continuing into Massachusetts and Brattleboro, Vermont.[208]\n\nBus[edit]\nStatewide bus service is supplied by Connecticut Transit, owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Connecticut Transit also operates CTfastrak, a bus rapid transit service between New Britain and Hartford, which opened to the public on March 28, 2015.[209][210][211]\n\nAir[edit]\nBradley International Airport, the state\'s largest\nConnecticut\'s largest airport is Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, 15 miles (24 km) north of Hartford.[citation needed] Many residents of central and southern Connecticut also make heavy use of JFK International Airport and Newark International Airports, especially for international travel. Smaller regional air service is provided at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport. Larger civil airports include Danbury Municipal Airport and Waterbury-Oxford Airport in western Connecticut, Hartfordâ€“Brainard Airport in central Connecticut, and Groton-New London Airport in eastern Connecticut. Sikorsky Memorial Airport is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.\n\nFerry[edit]\nSeveral ferry services cross Long Island Sound and connect the state to Long Island. The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry travels between Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Port Jefferson, New York.[212] Ferry service also operates out of New London to Orient, New York; Fishers Island, New York; and Block Island, Rhode Island, which are popular tourist destinations.[212] Two ferries cross the Connecticut River: the Rocky Hillâ€“Glastonbury ferry and the Chesterâ€“Hadlyme ferry, the former of which is the oldest continuously operating ferry in the United States, operating since 1655.[212]\n\nLaw and government[edit]\nMain articles: Law of Connecticut and Administrative divisions of Connecticut\nPart of a series on theLaw of Connecticut\n\nshowSources of law\nConstitution of Connecticut\nConnecticut General Statutes\n\nshowLegal history\nAlexander v.

Before then, New Haven and Hartford alternated as dual capitals.[55]\n\nConstitutional history[edit]\nMain article: History of the Connecticut Constitution\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut\'s pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth helped to orchestrate what became known as the Connecticut Compromise, or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut\'s plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\nThe nickname also might refer to the Fundamental Orders of 1638â€“39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state\'s constitutional history. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King Charles II of England through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern U.S. Constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\nExecutive[edit]\nThe governor heads the executive branch. As of 2020[update], Ned Lamont is the Governor[213] and Susan Bysiewicz is the Lieutenant Governor;[214] both are Democrats. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, Ella Grasso was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.[98]\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.[215]\nIn addition to the governor and lieutenant governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: secretary of the state, treasurer, comptroller, and attorney general. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.[55]\n\nLegislative[edit]\nConnecticut\'s legislative branch is known as the General Assembly. It is a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper body, the State Senate (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives).[55] Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto bills, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in both houses. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. The Speaker of the House presides over the House.[216] As of 2021[update], Matthew Ritter is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.\nAs of 2021[update], Connecticut\'s United States Senators are Richard Blumenthal (Democrat) and Chris Murphy (Democrat).[217] Connecticut has five representatives in the U.S. House, all of whom are Democrats.[218]\nLocally elected representatives also develop local ordinances to govern cities and towns.[219] The town ordinances often include noise control and zoning guidelines.[220] However, the State of Connecticut also provides statewide ordinances for noise control as well.[221]\n\nJudicial[edit]\nThe highest court of Connecticut\'s judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of laws, or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court: no testimony is given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. As of 2020[update], the Chief Justice is Richard A. Robinson.\nIn 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.[222] The Connecticut Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court, and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.\n\nLocal government[edit]\nMain article: Local government in Connecticut\nSee also: List of counties in Connecticut, Councils of governments in Connecticut, List of municipalities in Connecticut, and Borough (Connecticut)\nPlanning Regions of Connecticut\nConnecticut does not have county government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of sheriffs elected in each county.[223] In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the state marshal system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines.[224] The eight counties are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as weather reports and census reporting, although the latter of which will cease in 2024.\nThe state is divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.[225] The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body made up chief executive officers of the member towns. The regions are established for the purpose of planning \"coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations\".[225] By 2015, the State of Connecticut recognized COGs as county equivalents, allowing them to apply for funding and grants made available to county governments in other states. In 2019 the state recommended to the United States Census Bureau that the nine Councils of Governments replace its counties for statistical purposes.[226] This proposal was approved by the Census Bureau in 2022, and will be fully implemented by 2024.[227]\nConnecticut shares with the rest of New England a governmental institution called the New England town. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.[55] There are also 21 cities,[55] most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the City of Groton, which is a subsection of the Town of Groton, and the City of Winsted in the Town of Winchester. There are also nine incorporated boroughs which may provide additional services to a section of town.[55][228] Naugatuck is a consolidated town and borough.\n\nPolitics[edit]\nFurther information: Political party strength in Connecticut and Elections in ConnecticutConnecticut is generally considered to be a blue state. The last Republican presidential candidate to win Connecticut\'s votes in the Electoral College was George H. W. Bush in 1988.[229]Connecticut political party registration 1958â€“2012, marked with presidential influence\nRegistered voters[edit]\nConnecticut residents who register to vote may declare an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. As of 2022[update], around 58% of registered voters are enrolled in a political party. The Democratic Party of Connecticut is the largest party in the state by voter registration, with 36% of voters, followed by the Connecticut Republican Party with approximately 20%. An additional 1.6% are registered to third parties. As of 2022, 4 third parties have statewide enrollment privileges (meaning any state resident may register as a member), including the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, the Independent Party of Connecticut, the Connecticut Green Party, and the Connecticut Working Families Party.[230] Connecticut allows electoral fusion, where the same candidate can run on the ballot of more than one political party; this is often used by the Connecticut Working Families Party to cross-endorse Democratic candidates.[231]\n\n\n\nParty registration as of October 31, 2023 [232]\n\n\nParty\n\nTotal voters\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nUnaffiliated\n\n1,035,711\n\n42.0%\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic\n\n888,707\n\n36.1%\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\n\n500,485\n\n20.3%\n\n\n\n\nMinor parties\n\n39,656\n\n1.6%\n\n\nTotal\n\n2,464,919\n\n100%\n\nVoting[edit]\nIn July 2009, the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor M. Jodi Rell to pass SustiNet, the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.[233]\nIn April 2012, both houses of the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill (20 to 16 and 86 to 62) that abolished capital punishment for all future crimes, while 11 inmates who were waiting on the death row at the time could still be executed.[234]\n\nEducation[edit]\nMain article: Education in Connecticut\nFurther information: List of school districts in ConnecticutYale\'s motto means \"light and truth\".Connecticut ranked third in the nation for educational performance, according to Education Week\'s Quality Counts 2018 report. It earned an overall score of 83.5 out of 100 points. On average, the country received a score of 75.2.[235] Connecticut posted a B-plus in the Chance-for-Success category, ranking fourth on factors that contribute to a person\'s success both within and outside the K-12 education system. Connecticut received a mark of B-plus and finished fourth for School Finance. It ranked 12th with a grade of C on the K-12 Achievement Index.[235]\nKâ€“12[edit]\nSee also: Connecticut State Board of Education\nPublic schools[edit]\nHartford Public High School (1638) is the third-oldest secondary school in the nation after the Collegiate School (1628) in Manhattan and the Boston Latin School (1635). Today, the Connecticut State Board of Education manages the public school system for children in grades Kâ€“12. Board of Education members are appointed by the Governor of Connecticut.\n\nPrivate schools[edit]\nUniversity of Connecticut, the state\'s main public universityConnecticut has a number of private schools. Private schools may file for approval by the state Department of Education, but are not required to. Per state law, private schools must file yearly attendance reports with the state.[236]\nNotable private schools include Choate Rosemary Hall, The Hotchkiss School, Loomis Chaffee School, and Taft School.\n\nColleges and universities[edit]\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Connecticut\nConnecticut was home to the nation\'s first law school, Litchfield Law School, which operated from 1773 to 1833 in Litchfield. Well known universities in the state include Yale University, Wesleyan University, Trinity College, Sacred Heart University, Fairfield University, Quinnipiac University, and the University of Connecticut. The Connecticut State University System includes 4 state universities, and the state also has 12 community colleges. The United States Coast Guard Academy is located in New London.\n\nSports[edit]\nThere are two Connecticut teams in the American Hockey League. The Bridgeport Islanders is a farm team for the New York Islanders which competes at the Total Mortgage Arena in Bridgeport. The Hartford Wolf Pack is an affiliate of the New York Rangers; they play in the XL Center in Hartford.\nThe Hartford Yard Goats of the Double-A Northeast are a AA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. Also, the Norwich Sea Unicorns play in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League. The New Britain Bees play in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. The Connecticut Sun of the WNBA currently play at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville. In soccer, Hartford Athletic began play in the USL Championship in 2019.\nThe state hosts several major sporting events. Since 1952, a PGA Tour golf tournament has been played in the Hartford area. It was originally called the \"Insurance City Open\" and later the \"Greater Hartford Open\" and is now known as the Travelers Championship. \n\nLime Rock, a home of the American Le Mans Series\nLime Rock Park in Salisbury is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) road racing course, home to the International Motor Sports Association, SCCA, United States Auto Club, and K&N Pro Series East races. Thompson International Speedway, Stafford Motor Speedway, and Waterford Speedbowl are oval tracks holding weekly races for NASCAR Modifieds and other classes, including the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. The state also hosts several major mixed martial arts events for Bellator MMA and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\nProfessional sports teams[edit]\nThe Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League played in Hartford from 1975 to 1997 at the Hartford Civic Center. They departed to Raleigh, North Carolina, after disputes with the state over the construction of a new arena, and they are now known as the Carolina Hurricanes. A baseball team known as the Hartfords (or Hartford Dark Blues) played in the National Association from 1874 to 1875, before becoming charter members of the National League in 1876. The team moved to Brooklyn, New York, and then disbanded one season later. In 1926, Hartford also had a franchise in the National Football League known as the Hartford Blues.[237] From 2000 until 2006 the city was home to the Hartford FoxForce of World TeamTennis.[238]\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nSport\n\nLeague\n\n\nBridgeport Islanders\n\nIce hockey\n\nAmerican Hockey League\n\n\nHartford Wolf Pack\n\nIce hockey\n\nAmerican Hockey League\n\n\nHartford Yard Goats\n\nBaseball\n\nDouble-A Northeast\n\n\nNorwich Sea Unicorns\n\nBaseball\n\nFutures Collegiate Baseball League\n\n\nNew Britain Bees\n\nBaseball\n\nFutures Collegiate Baseball League\n\n\nConnecticut Sun\n\nBasketball\n\nWomen\'s National Basketball Association\n\n\nHartford Athletic\n\nSoccer\n\nUSL Championship\n\n\nAC Connecticut\n\nSoccer\n\nUSL League Two\n\nCollege sports[edit]\nYale Bowl during \"The Game\" between Yale and Harvard. The Bowl was also the home of the NFL\'s New York Giants in 1973â€“74.\nThe Connecticut Huskies are the team of the University of Connecticut (UConn); they play NCAA Division I sports. Both the men\'s basketball and women\'s basketball teams have won multiple national championships. In 2004, UConn became the first school in NCAA Division I history to have its men\'s and women\'s basketball programs win the national title in the same year; they repeated the feat in 2014 and are still the only Division I school to win both titles in the same year.[239][240] The UConn women\'s basketball team holds the record for the longest consecutive winning streak in NCAA college basketball at 111 games, a streak that ended in 2017.[241] The UConn Huskies football team has played in the Football Bowl Subdivision since 2002, and has played in four bowl games.\nNew Haven biennially hosts \"The Game\" between the Yale Bulldogs and the Harvard Crimson, the country\'s second-oldest college football rivalry. Yale alumnus Walter Camp is deemed the \"Father of American Football\", and he helped develop modern football while living in New Haven.[242] Other Connecticut universities which feature Division I sports teams are Quinnipiac University, Fairfield University, Central Connecticut State University and Sacred Heart University.\n\nEtymology and symbols[edit]\nState symbols of ConnecticutList of state symbolsFlag of ConnecticutSeal of ConnecticutCoat of arms of ConnecticutMotto\nQui transtulit sustinet Latin\n\"He Who Transplanted Still Sustains\"\nSloganFull of SurprisesSong\n\"Yankee Doodle\"\n\"The Nutmeg\"\nLiving insigniaBirdAmerican robinFishAmerican shadFlowerMountain laurelInsectEuropean mantisMammalSperm whaleTreeCharter Oak, a white oakInanimate insigniaDanceSquare danceFossilDinosaur tracksMineralGarnetShellEastern oysterShipUSS Nautilus (SSN-571), Freedom Schooner AmistadTartanConnecticut State TartanState route markerState quarterReleased in 1999Lists of United States state symbols\nThe name \"Connecticut\" originated with the Mohegan word quonehtacut, meaning \"place of long tidal river\".[55] Connecticut\'s official nickname is \"The Constitution State\", adopted in 1959 and based on its colonial constitution of 1638â€“1639 which was the first in America and, arguably, the world.[1] Connecticut is also unofficially known as \"The Nutmeg State\",[1] whose origin is unknown. It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg, which was a very valuable spice in the 18th and 19th centuries. It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from Yankee peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved knobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.[243] George Washington gave Connecticut the title of \"The Provisions State\"[1] because of the material aid that the state rendered to the American Revolutionary War effort. Connecticut is also known as \"The Land of Steady Habits\".[1]\nAccording to Webster\'s New International Dictionary (1993), a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a \"Connecticuter\". There are numerous other terms coined in print but not in use, such as \"Connecticotian\" (Cotton Mather in 1702) and \"Connecticutensian\" (Samuel Peters in 1781). Linguist Allen Walker Read suggests the more playful term \"Connecticutie\".[244] \"Nutmegger\" is sometimes used,[243] as is \"Yankee\".\nThe official state song is \"Yankee Doodle\". The traditional abbreviation of the state\'s name is \"Conn.\"; the official postal abbreviation is CT.\nCommemorative stamps issued by the United States Postal Service with Connecticut themes include Nathan Hale, Eugene O\'Neill, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Noah Webster, Eli Whitney, the whaling ship the Charles W. Morgan, which is docked at Mystic Seaport, and a decoy of a broadbill duck.\n\n\n\n\nThe Charter Oak\n\n\n\nThe USS Nautilus (SSN-571)\n\n\n\nConnecticut state insignia and historical figuresSource Sites, Seals & Symbols except where noted.\n\n\nState aircraft\nVought F4U Corsair\n\n\nState hero\nNathan Hale\n\n\nState heroine\nPrudence Crandall\n\n\nState composer\nCharles Edward Ives\n\n\nState statues in Statuary Hall\nRoger Sherman and Jonathan Trumbull\n\n\nState poet laureate\nMargaret Gibson[245]\n\n\nConnecticut State Troubadour\nNekita Waller[246]\n\n\nState composer laureate\nJacob Druckman\n\nNotable people[edit]\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of people from Connecticut.\nSee also[edit]\n\nConnecticut portalNew England portalUnited States portal\nIndex of Connecticut-related articles\nOutline of Connecticut\nList of states and territories of the United States\nUSS Connecticut, 7 ships\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988\n\n^ Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c d e \"Sites, Seals & Symbols\".

For uses in the natural sciences, see Cell culture and Tissue culture. For other uses, see Culture (disambiguation).\n\n\nHuman symbolic expression developed as prehistoric humans reached behavioral modernity.\nReligion and expressive art are important aspects of human culture.\nGermans marching during a folk culture celebration\nCulture (/ˈkʌltʃər/ KUL-chər) is a concept that encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups.[1] Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location.\nHumans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.\nA cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.\nAccepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.[2]\nThus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.\nCultural change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society.[3] Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies.\nOrganizations like UNESCO attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.\n\n\nDescription\nPygmy music has been polyphonic well before their discovery by non-African explorers of the Baka, Aka, Efe, and other foragers of the Central African forests, in the 1200s, which is at least 200 years before polyphony developed in Europe. Note the multiple lines of singers and dancers. The motifs are independent, with theme and variation interweaving.[4] This type of music is thought to be the first expression of polyphony in world music.\nCulture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. Cultural universals are found in all human societies. These include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society.[5]\nIn the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture, or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the proletariat and create a false consciousness. Such perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.\nWhen used as a count noun, a \"culture\" is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes \"culture\" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g. \"bro culture\"), or a counterculture. Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance of cultural relativism hold that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.\n\nEtymology\nThe modern term \"culture\" is based on a term used by the ancient Roman orator Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes, where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or \"cultura animi\",[6] using an agricultural metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development. Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man\'s natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, \"refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human.\"[7]\nIn 1986, philosopher Edward S. Casey wrote, \"The very word culture meant \'place tilled\' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin colere, \'to inhabit, care for, till, worship\' and cultus, \'A cult, especially a religious one.\' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly.\"[8]\n\nCulture described by Richard Velkley:[7] ... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing Rousseau\'s criticism of \"modern liberalism and Enlightenment.\" Thus a contrast between \"culture\" and \"civilization\" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.\nIn the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\"[9] Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.[10]\nThe Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is \"the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time.\"[11] Terror management theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as \"person[s] of worth within the world of meaning\"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo sapiens became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.[12][13]\nThe word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to humans. However, some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complicated, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.[citation needed]\n\nChange\nMain article: Culture change\nThe Beatles exemplified changing cultural dynamics, not only in music, but fashion and lifestyle. Over a half century after their emergence, they continue to have a worldwide cultural impact.\nRaimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation.[14] In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.[15]\n\nA 19th-century engraving showing Australian natives opposing the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1770\nCultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global \"accelerating culture change period,\" driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.[16]\nCultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social structures and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.[17]\nSocial conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models, and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.[18]\n\nTurkmen woman, on a carpet at the entrance to a yurt, in traditional clothing. Sense of time is dependent on culture. A 1913 photo, but can be difficult to date for a viewer, due to the absence of cultural cues.\nCultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century.[19] \"Stimulus diffusion\" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. \"Direct borrowing,\" on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.[20]\nAcculturation has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what happened to certain Native American tribes and many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes on an individual level include assimilation (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.\n\nEarly modern discourses\nGerman Romanticism\nJohann Herder called attention to national cultures.\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of \"enlightenment\" similar to the concept of bildung: \"Enlightenment is man\'s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\"[21] He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: \"Sapere Aude\" (\"Dare to be wise!\"). In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of Bildung: \"For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people.\"[22]\n\nAdolf Bastian developed a universal model of culture.\nIn 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant\'s and Herder\'s interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with nationalist movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a \"Germany\" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as \"worldview\" (Weltanschauung).[23] According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \"civilized\" and \"primitive\" or \"tribal\" cultures.\nIn 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for \"the psychic unity of mankind.\"[24] He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \"elementary ideas\" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different \"folk ideas\" (Völkergedanken), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.[25] This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.[26]\n\n\nEnglish Romanticism\nBritish poet and critic Matthew Arnold viewed \"culture\" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.\nIn the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) used the word \"culture\" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of \"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\"[27] This concept of culture is also comparable to the German concept of bildung: \"...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.\"[27]\nIn practice, culture referred to an elite ideal and was associated with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine.[28] As these forms were associated with urban life, \"culture\" was identified with \"civilization\" (from Latin: civitas, lit. \'city\'). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \"culture\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.[29]\n\nBritish anthropologist Edward Tylor was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.\nMatthew Arnold contrasted \"culture\" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted \"culture\" with \"the state of nature.\" According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \"civilized\" and \"uncivilized.\"[30] According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer\'s theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan\'s theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.\nOther 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people\'s essential nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by \"the folk,\" i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as \"noble savages\" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West.\nIn 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.[31] In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of religion.\n\nAnthropology\nMain article: American anthropology\nPetroglyphs in modern-day Gobustan, Azerbaijan, dating back to 10,000 BCE and indicating a thriving culture\nAlthough anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor\'s definition of culture,[32] in the 20th century \"culture\" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially.[33] American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and in the United States and Canada, archaeology.[34][35][36][37] The term Kulturbrille, or \"culture glasses,\" coined by German American anthropologist Franz Boas, refers to the \"lenses\" through which a person sees their own culture. Martin Lindstrom asserts that Kulturbrille, which allow a person to make sense of the culture they inhabit, \"can blind us to things outsiders pick up immediately.\"[38]\n\nSociology\nMain article: Sociology of culture\nAn example of folkloric dancing in Colombia\nThe sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history.\"[39] As such, culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people\'s way of life. Culture can be either of two types, non-material culture or material culture.[5] Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.\nCultural sociology first emerged in Weimar Germany (1918–1933), where sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term Kultursoziologie (\'cultural sociology\'). Cultural sociology was then reinvented in the English-speaking world as a product of the cultural turn of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.[40] Culture has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead, look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science.[41]\n\nNowruz is a good sample of popular and folklore culture that is celebrated by people in more than 22 countries with different nations and religions, at the 1st day of spring. It has been celebrated by diverse communities for over 7,000 years.\nEarly researchers and development of cultural sociology\nThe sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx,[42] Durkheim, and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural, sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.\n\nCultural studies\nMain article: Cultural studies\nIn the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988) developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified culture with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.[43][44]\nIn the United Kingdom, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of popular culture; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.[45] It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall,[46] who succeeded Hoggart as Director.[47] Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as Western civilization or globalism.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. Visual art is one expression of culture.\nFrom the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall\'s pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[48] Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one\'s participation in this practice.\nIn the context of cultural studies, a text includes not only written language, but also films, photographs, fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.[49] Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of culture. Culture, for a cultural-studies researcher, not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups)[50] and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies.[51]\nScholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, E.P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as \"capitalist\" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the \"culture industry\" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.\nIn the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \"cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition.\"[52] The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, the mode and relations of production form the economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences superstructures, such as culture.[53] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.),[54] which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[55]\nPetrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:[56]\n\nThe first group covers the variables that represent the \"efficiency orientation\" of the societies: performance orientation, future orientation, assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance.\nThe second covers the variables that represent the \"social orientation\" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human orientation.\nIn 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by Rein Raud,[15] who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.\n\nPsychology\nSee also: Social psychology, Cultural psychology, and Cross-cultural psychology\nCognitive tools suggest a way for people from certain culture to deal with real-life problems, like Suanpan for Chinese to perform mathematical calculation.\nStarting in the 1990s,[57]: 31  psychological research on culture influence began to grow and challenge the universality assumed in general psychology.[58]: 158–168 [59] Culture psychologists began to try to explore the relationship between emotions and culture, and answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. For example, people from collectivistic cultures, such as the Japanese, suppress their positive emotions more than their American counterparts.[60] Culture may affect the way that people experience and express emotions. On the other hand, some researchers try to look for differences between people\'s personalities across cultures.[61][62] As different cultures dictate distinctive norms, culture shock is also studied to understand how people react when they are confronted with other cultures. Cognitive tools may not be accessible or they may function differently cross culture.[57]: 19  For example, people who are raised in a culture with an abacus are trained with distinctive reasoning style.[63] Cultural lenses may also make people view the same outcome of events differently. Westerners are more motivated by their successes than their failures, while East Asians are better motivated by the avoidance of failure.[64] Culture is important for psychologists to consider when understanding the human mental operation.\nThe notion of the anxious, unstable, and rebellious adolescent has been criticized by experts, such as Robert Epstein, who state that an undeveloped brain is not the main cause of teenagers\' turmoils.[65][66] Some have criticized this understanding of adolescence, classifying it as a relatively recent phenomenon in human history created by modern society,[67][68][69][70] and have been highly critical of what they view as the infantilization of young adults in American society.[71] According to Robert Epstein and Jennifer, \"American-style teen turmoil is absent in more than 100 cultures around the world, suggesting that such mayhem is not biologically inevitable. Second, the brain itself changes in response to experiences, raising the question of whether adolescent brain characteristics are the cause of teen tumult or rather the result of lifestyle and experiences.\"[72] David Moshman has also stated in regards to adolescence that brain research \"is crucial for a full picture, but it does not provide an ultimate explanation.\"[73]\n\nProtection of culture\nRestoration of an ancient Egyptian monument\nThere are a number of international agreements and national laws relating to the protection of cultural heritage and cultural diversity. UNESCO and its partner organizations such as Blue Shield International coordinate international protection and local implementation.[74][75] The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deal with the protection of culture. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights deals with cultural heritage in two ways: it gives people the right to participate in cultural life on the one hand and the right to the protection of their contributions to cultural life on the other.[76]\nIn the 21st century, the protection of culture has been the focus of increasing activity by national and international organizations. The UN and UNESCO promote cultural preservation and cultural diversity through declarations and legally-binding conventions or treaties. The aim is not to protect a person\'s property, but rather to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity, especially in the event of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the identity of the opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to affect the particularly sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or municipality.[77][78][79]\nTourism is having an increasing impact on the various forms of culture. On the one hand, this can be physical impact on individual objects or the destruction caused by increasing environmental pollution and, on the other hand, socio-cultural effects on society.[80][81][82]\n\nSee also\n\nSociety portalWorld portal\nAnimal culture\nAnthropology\nCultural area\nCultural studies\nCultural identity\nCultural tourism\nCulture 21 – United Nations plan of action\nHonour § Cultures of honour and cultures of law\nOutline of culture\nRecombinant culture\nSemiotics of culture\nReferences\n\n\n^ Tylor, Edward.

Literally, it refers to \"武 martial\" and \"艺 arts\".\nIt was first used in the Japanese-English dictionary \"Takenobu Japanese-English Dictionary (Collection of the National Diet Library of Japan)\" published by a Japanese person in 1918, and then spread to the general public in the West. This is why the term \"martial arts\" is now often associated with oriental martial arts that are strongly associated with orientalism, rather than simply referring to combat systems.[citation needed]\nAccording to Paul Bowman, the term martial arts was popularized by mainstream popular culture during the 1960s to 1970s, notably by Hong Kong martial arts films (most famously those of Bruce Lee) during the so-called \"chopsocky\" wave of the early 1970s.[2]\nAccording to John Clements, the term martial arts itself is derived from an older Latin term meaning \"arts of Mars\", the Roman god of war, and was used to refer to the combat systems of Europe (European martial arts) as early as the 1550s.[3] in contrast to the Japanese term Budo, (武道), The character Bu 武 the Chinese Han character, meaning to stopping the blades or oppose Violence, and Do 道 meaning path, translated as the path or way against violence, Denoting traditional training in Japan for the exponent was to transcend doing harm to another by redirecting the personal ego towards more positive virtuous endeavours.[citation needed]\nThe term martial science, or martial sciences, was commonly used to refer to the fighting arts of East Asia (Asian martial arts) up until the 1970s, while the term Chinese boxing was also used to refer to Chinese martial arts up until then.[4]\nSome authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate terms on the basis that many martial arts were never \"martial\" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.[5]\n\nVariation and scope[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nMartial arts may be categorized using a variety of criteria, including:[citation needed]\n\nTraditional/historical arts vs. contemporary styles: e.g., folk wrestling compared to modern hybrid martial arts.\nTechniques taught: armed vs. unarmed, and within these categories\narmed: by type of weapon (swordsmanship, stick fighting etc.)\nunarmed: by type of combat (grappling, striking, stand-up fighting, ground fighting)\nBy application or intent: self-defense, combat sport, choreography or demonstration of forms, physical fitness, meditation, etc.\nWithin Chinese tradition: \"external\" vs. \"internal\" styles\nBy technical focus[edit]\nUnarmed[edit]\nUnarmed martial arts can be broadly grouped into those focusing on strikes, those focusing on grappling, and those that cover both fields, often described as hybrid martial arts.[citation needed]\n\nStrikes: punching and kicking techniques displayed at the Banteay Srei (967 A.D.) in Cambodia.\nStrikes\n\nPunching: Boxing, Wing Chun\nKicking: Kickboxing, Taekwondo, Capoeira, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Taekyyon\nElbow Strike: Kung Fu, Karate, Muay Thai\nKnee Strike: Lethwei, Muay Thai, Bokator, Kung Fu\nOthers using strikes: Lethwei, Muay Thai, Kung Fu, Pencak Silat, Taijiquan, Vovinam\nGrappling: bas-relief of grappling techniques at Prambanan (9th century) in Indonesia.\nGrappling\n\nThrowing: Hapkido, Judo, Sumo, Wrestling, Aikido, Shuai Jiao, Taijiquan\nJoint lock/Chokeholds/Submission holds: Jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Catch wrestling, Judo, Chin-na, Taijiquan\nPinning Techniques: Judo, Wrestling, Aikido\nTrapping/Clinch fighting: Wing Chun, Filipino Martial Arts, Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, wrestling, Judo\nArmed[edit]\nThe traditional martial arts that cover armed combat often encompass a wide spectrum of melee weapons, including bladed weapons and polearms. Such traditions include eskrima, silat, kalaripayat, kobudo, and historical European martial arts, especially those of the Italian Renaissance. Many Chinese martial arts also feature weapons as part of their curriculum.[citation needed]\nSometimes, training with one specific weapon may be considered a style in its own right, especially in the case of Japanese martial arts, with disciplines such as kenjutsu and kendo (sword), bojutsu (staff), and kyūdō (archery). Similarly, modern martial arts and sports include modern fencing, stick-fighting systems like canne de combat, modern competitive archery and practical shooting.[citation needed]\n\nBy application or intent[edit]\nCombat-oriented[edit]\nMain articles: Combat sport and Self-defense\nHealth-oriented[edit]\nMany martial arts, especially those from East Asia, are taught from the foundations of traditional medical theory for the prevention of disease and illness and a long life. This is particularly prevalent in traditional Asian martial arts which may teach bone-setting, herbalism, food therapy, Shiatsu, Daoyin and other aspects of traditional medicine including acupressure.[citation needed]\n\nSpirituality-oriented[edit]\nMartial arts can also be linked with religion and spirituality. Numerous systems are reputed to have been founded, disseminated, or practiced by monks or nuns.[citation needed]\nJapanese styles, when concerning non-physical qualities of the combat, are often strongly influenced by Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Concepts like \"empty mind\" and \"beginner\'s mind\" are recurrent. Aikido practitioners for instance, can have a strong philosophical belief of the flow of energy called Ki and peace fostering, as idealised by the art\'s founder Morihei Ueshiba.[citation needed]\nTraditional Korean martial arts place emphasis on the development of the practitioner\'s spiritual and philosophical being. A common theme in most Korean styles, such as Taekkyon, taekwondo, and Hapkido is the value of \"inner peace\" in a practitioner, which is stressed to be only achievable through individual meditation and training. The Koreans believe that the use of physical force is only justifiable for self defense.[6]\nSystema draws upon breathing and relaxation techniques, as well as elements of Russian Orthodox thought, to foster self-conscience and calmness, and to benefit the practitioner in different levels: the physical, the psychological and the spiritual.[citation needed]\nSome martial arts in various cultures can be performed in dance-like settings for various reasons, such as for evoking ferocity in preparation for battle or showing off skill in a more stylized manner, with capoeira being the most prominent example. Many such martial arts incorporate music, especially strong percussive rhythms (see also war dance).[citation needed]\nPahlevani and zourkhaneh rituals is the name of a Persian Martial arts inscribed by UNESCO for varzesh-e pahlavāni (Persian: آیین پهلوانی و زورخانه‌ای, \"heroic sport\")[7] or varzesh-e bāstāni (ورزش باستانی; varzeš-e bāstānī, \"ancient sport\"), a traditional system of athletics originally used to train warriors in Iran (Persia), and first appearing under this name and form in the Safavid era, with similarities to systems in adjacent lands under other names.[8][9]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of martial arts\nFurther information: Martial arts timeline\nHistorical martial arts[edit]\nMain articles: History of Asian martial arts and Historical European martial arts\nDetail of the wrestling fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan\nThe martial art of boxing was practiced in ancient Thera (1600–1500 BC).Human warfare dates back to the Epipalaeolithic to early Neolithic era. The oldest works of art depicting scenes of battle are cave paintings from eastern Spain (Spanish Levante) dated between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE that show organized groups fighting with bows and arrows.[10][11] Similar evidence of warfare has been found in Epipalaeolithic to early Neolithic era mass burials, excavated in Germany and at Jebel Sahaba in Northern Sudan.[10]\nWrestling is the oldest combat sport, with origins in hand-to-hand combat. Belt wrestling was depicted in works of art from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt c. 3000 BC, and later in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.[12] The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the 3rd millennium BC.[13]\n\nA Chinese martial artist preparing to throw his opponent off the lei tai during a Jiaoli contest in the Qin Dynasty.\nThe foundation of modern East Asian martial arts and South Asian martial arts is likely facilitated by cultural exchanges of early Chinese and Indian martial arts. During the Warring States period of Chinese history (480–221 BC) extensive development in martial philosophy and strategy emerged, as described by Sun Tzu in The Art of War (c. 350 BC).[14] Legendary accounts link the origin of Shaolinquan to the spread of Buddhism from ancient India during the early 5th century CE, with the figure of Bodhidharma, to China.[15] Written evidence of martial arts in Southern India dates back to the Sangam literature of about the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century AD.[16] The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu[17]\nIn Europe, the earliest sources of martial arts traditions date to Ancient Greece. Boxing (pygme, pyx), wrestling (pale) and pankration  were represented in the Ancient Olympic Games. The Romans produced gladiatorial combat as a public spectacle.[18]\n\nElbow strike and weapons techniques. Bas-relief at Angkor Wat (12th century) in Cambodia.\nA number of historical combat manuals have survived from the European Middle Ages. This includes such styles as sword and shield, two-handed swordfighting and other types of melee weapons besides unarmed combat. Amongst these are transcriptions of Johannes Liechtenauer\'s mnemonic poem on the longsword dating back to the late fourteenth century. Likewise, Asian martial arts became well-documented during the medieval period, Japanese martial arts beginning with the establishment of the samurai nobility in the 12th century, Chinese martial arts with Ming era treatises such as Ji Xiao Xin Shu, Indian martial arts in medieval texts such as the Agni Purana and the Malla Purana, and Korean martial arts from the Joseon era and texts such as Muyejebo (1598).[citation needed]\n\nJapanese swordsman as depicted in the Boxer Codex (c. 1590)\nEuropean swordsmanship always had a sportive component, but the duel was always a possibility until World War I. Modern sport fencing began developing during the 19th century as the French and Italian military academies began codifying instruction. The Olympic games led to standard international rules, with the Féderation Internationale d\'Escrime founded in 1913. Modern boxing originates with Jack Broughton\'s rules in the 18th century, and reaches its present form with the Marquess of Queensberry Rules of 1867.[citation needed]\n\nFolk styles[edit]\nMain article: Folk wrestling\nDrawing of Indian wrestlers carrying vajra-mushti (1792 A.D.)\nCertain traditional combat sports and fighting styles exist all over the world, rooted in local culture and folklore. The most common of these are styles of folk wrestling, some of which have been practiced since antiquity and are found in the most remote areas. Other examples include forms of stick fighting and boxing. While these arts are based on historical traditions of folklore, they are not \"historical\" in the sense that they reconstruct or preserve a historical system from a specific era. They are rather contemporary regional sports that coexist with the modern forms of martial arts sports as they have developed since the 19th century, often including cross-fertilization between sports and folk styles; thus, the traditional Thai art of muay boran developed into the modern national sport of muay Thai, which in turn came to be practiced worldwide and contributed significantly to modern hybrid styles like kickboxing and mixed martial arts. Singlestick, an English martial art can be seen often used in morris dancing. Many European dances share elements of martial arts with examples including Ukrainian Hopak, Polish Zbójnicki (use of ciupaga), the Czech dance odzemek, and the Norwegian Halling.[citation needed]\n\nBoxing in England, 1811\nModern history[edit]\nFurther information: Modern history of East Asian martial arts\nLate 19th to early 20th century[edit]\nThe mid to late 19th century marks the beginning of the history of martial arts as modern sports developed out of earlier traditional fighting systems. In Europe, this concerns the developments of boxing, wrestling and fencing as sports. In Japan, the same period marks the formation of the modern forms of judo, jujutsu, karate, and kendo (among others) based on revivals of old schools of Edo period martial arts which had been suppressed during the Meiji Restoration[19]  In 1882, Kano Jigoro established the Kodokan School of judo which began the sport of judo.[20]  Kano Jigoro had gathered the old knowledge of jujutsu before establishing his school of judo.\nModern muay Thai rules date to the 1920s. In China, the modern history of martial arts begins in the Nanjing decade (1930s) following the foundation of the Central Guoshu Institute in 1928 under the Kuomintang government.[citation needed]\nWestern interest in Asian martial arts arises towards the end of the 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the United States with China and Japan.[21] Relatively few Westerners actually practiced the arts, considering it to be mere performance. Edward William Barton-Wright, a railway engineer who had studied jujutsu while working in Japan between 1894 and 1897, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic style named Bartitsu which combined jujutsu, judo, wrestling, boxing, savate and stick fighting.[citation needed][22]\nFencing and Greco-Roman wrestling was included in the 1896 Summer Olympics. FILA Wrestling World Championships and Boxing at the Summer Olympics were introduced in 1904. The tradition of awarding championship belts in wrestling and boxing can be traced to the Lonsdale Belt, introduced in 1909.[23]\n\nBoxing in 1943\n20th century (1914 to 1989)[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nBruce Lee (right) and his teacher Ip Man (left)\nKarate in Naha before the war; (before 1946)\nThe International Boxing Association was established in 1920. World Fencing Championships have been held since 1921.\nAs Western influence grew in Asia a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan and South Korea during World War II and the Korean War and were exposed to local fighting styles. Jujutsu, judo and karate first became popular among the mainstream from the 1950s–1960s. Due in part to Asian and Hollywood martial arts movies, most modern American martial arts are either Asian-derived or Asian influenced.[24] The term kickboxing (キックボクシング) was created by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a variant of muay Thai and karate that he created in the 1950s. American kickboxing was developed in the 1970s, as a combination of boxing and karate. Taekwondo was developed in the context of the Korean War in the 1950s.\nThe later 1960s and 1970s witnessed an increased media interest in Chinese martial arts, influenced by martial artist Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee is credited as one of the first instructors to openly teach Chinese martial arts to Westerners.[25] World Judo Championships have been held since 1956, Judo at the Summer Olympics was introduced in 1964. Karate World Championships were introduced in 1970.\nThe \"kung fu wave\" of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1970s, especially Bruce Lee films, popularized martial arts in global popular culture. A number of mainstream films produced during the 1980s also contributed significantly to the perception of martial arts in Western popular culture. These include The Karate Kid (1984) and Bloodsport (1988). This era produced some Hollywood action stars with martial arts background, such as Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.\nAlso during the 20th century, a number of martial arts were adapted for self-defense purposes for military hand-to-hand combat. World War II combatives, KAPAP (1930s) and Krav Maga (1950s) in Israel, Systema in Soviet-era Russia, and Sanshou in the People\'s Republic of China are examples of such systems. The US military de-emphasized hand-to-hand combat training during the Cold War period, but revived it with the introduction of LINE in 1989.\n\n1990 to present[edit]\nIn 1993, the first Pancrase event was held in Japan.[26] The K-1 rules of kickboxing were introduced, based on 1980s Seidokaikan karate.[27]\nDuring the 1990s, Brazilian jiu-jitsu became popular and proved to be effective in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions such as the UFC and PRIDE.[28]\n\nMixed martial arts championship in Russia in 2021\nJackie Chan and Bruce Lee were prominent martial artists who became major movie figures. Their popularity and media presence has been at the forefront for promoting Chinese martial arts in the Western world since the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[29]\nWith the continual discovery of more medieval and Renaissance fighting manuals, the practice of Historical European Martial Arts and other Western Martial Arts have been growing[citation needed] in popularity across the United States and Europe.[citation needed]\nOn 29 November 2011, UNESCO inscribed Taekkyon onto its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.[30]\n\nRevival[edit]\nMany styles of Indian martial arts were banned by the colonial authorities during the period of British rule in India, which led to a decline in their popularity.[31] Some, such as Kalaripayattu, were able to resist this decline by practicing in secret. Other Indian martial art, such as Silambam, while not widely practiced in India, continue to be practiced in other countries in the Indian cultural sphere such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Many other Indian martial arts such as Mardhani Khel and Paika Akhada survived by practitioners practicing the art in secret, or by telling the colonial authorities that it was a form of dance. While many regional Indian martial arts forms are fading into obscurity, martial arts such as Gatka and Kalaripayattu are experiencing a gradual resurgence.[32]\n\nTesting and competition[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nTesting or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. Students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement, such as a different belt color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or sparring.\n\nSteven Ho executing a Jump Spin Hook Kick\nVarious forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments. Some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules, these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions. Rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into light-contact, medium-contact, and full-contact variants, reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent.\n\nLight- and medium-contact[edit]\nThese types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent, in the case of light sparring this is usually to \'touch\' contact, e.g. a punch should be \'pulled\' as soon as or before contact is made. In medium-contact (sometimes referred to as semi-contact) the punch would not be \'pulled\' but not hit with full force. As the amount of force used is restricted, the aim of these types of sparring is not to knock out an opponent; a point system is used in competitions.\nA referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match, while judges mark down scores, as in boxing. Particular targets may be prohibited, certain techniques may be forbidden (such as headbutting or groin hits), and fighters may be required to wear protective equipment on their head, hands, chest, groin, shins or feet. Some grappling arts, such as aikido, use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact.\nIn some styles (such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring), competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee, whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match, award a point, then restart the match. Alternatively, sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges. Some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness. Lighter-contact sparring may be used exclusively, for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate (such as beginners), medium-contact sparring is often used as training for full contact.\n\nFull-contact[edit]\nFurther information: Full-contact\nFull-contact sparring or competition, where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies, has a number of tactical differences from light and medium-contact sparring. It is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat.[33]\nIn full-contact sparring, the aim of a competitive match is to knock out the opponent or to force the opponent to submit.\nWhere scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure, only used if no clear winner has been established by other means; in some competitions, such as the UFC 1, there was no scoring, though most now use some form of judging as a backup.[34] Due to these factors, full-contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character, but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment, or limit the techniques allowed.\nNearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as UFC, Pancrase, Shooto use a form of full-contact rules as do professional boxing organizations and K-1. Kyokushin karate requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate gi, mouthguard, groin guard for males, or chest guard worn under the karate gi for females. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by World Taekwondo requires the use of Headgear and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body, and win by knockout is possible.\n\nMartial sport[edit]\nSee also: Combat sport\nSeveral martial arts, such as judo, are Olympic sports.\nKarate Fighting championship\nMartial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of sparring become competitive, becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while Chinese wushu recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as aikido generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.\nThe question of \"which is the best martial art\" has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations. This was the origin of the first Ultimate Fighting Championship tournament (later renamed UFC 1: The Beginning) in the USA inspired by the Brazilian Vale tudo tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions, most notably those from Japan such as Shooto and Pancrase, have evolved into the combat sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).\nSome martial artists compete in non-sparring competitions such as breaking or choreographed routines of techniques such as poomse, kata and aka, or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance-influenced competitions such as tricking. Martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport-like for political purposes; the central impetus for the attempt by the People\'s Republic of China in transforming Chinese martial arts into the committee-regulated sport of wushu was suppressing what they saw as the potentially subversive aspects of martial training, especially under the traditional system of family lineages.[35]\n\nHealth and fitness benefits[edit]\nMartial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees, such as their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.[36]\nThrough systematic practice in the martial arts a person\'s physical fitness may be boosted (strength, stamina, speed, flexibility, movement coordination, etc.) as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated. [citation needed]\nBeyond contributing to physical fitness, martial arts training also has benefits for mental health, contributing to self-esteem, self-control, emotional and spiritual well-being. For this reason, a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects, de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self-defense or combat completely.[citation needed]\nAccording to Bruce Lee, martial arts also have the nature of an art, since there is emotional communication and complete emotional expression.[citation needed]\n\nSelf-defense, military and law enforcement applications[edit]\nMain articles: Hand-to-hand combat and Self-defense\nU.S. Army combatives instructor demonstrates a chokehold.\nSome traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training. Perhaps the most recent example of this is point shooting which relies on muscle memory to more effectively use a firearm in a variety of awkward situations, much the way an iaidoka would master movements with their sword.\n\nDemonstration of a Ju-Jitsu defense against a knife attack. Berlin 1924\nDuring the World War II era William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes were recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to teach their martial art of Defendu (itself drawing on Western boxing and Jujutsu) and pistol shooting to UK, US, and Canadian special forces. The book Kill or Get Killed, written by Colonel Rex Applegate, was based on the Defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn\'s Get Tough and Appelgate\'s Kill or Get Killed became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.[citation needed]\nTraditional hand-to-hand, knife, and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today\'s wars. Examples of this include European Unifight, the US Army\'s Combatives system developed by Matt Larsen, the Israeli army\'s KAPAP and Krav Maga, and the US Marine Corps\'s Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of Fiore dei Liberi and the Codex Wallerstein were integrated into the U.S. Army\'s training manuals in 1942[37]\nand continue to influence today\'s systems along with other traditional systems such as eskrima and silat.[citation needed]\nThe rifle-mounted bayonet which has its origin in the spear, has seen use by the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, and the British Army as recently as the Iraq War.[38]\nMany martial arts are also seen and used in Law Enforcement hand-to-hand training. For example, the Tokyo Riot Police\'s use of aikido.[39]\n\nMartial arts industry[edit]\nMartial arts since the 1970s has become a significant industry, a subset of the wider sport industry (including cinema and sports television).[citation needed]\nHundreds of millions of people worldwide practice some form of martial art.\nWeb Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) claims there are 50 million karate practitioners worldwide.[40]\nThe South Korean government in 2009 published an estimate that taekwondo is practiced by 70 million people in 190 countries.[41]\nThe wholesale value of martial arts related sporting equipment shipped in the United States was estimated at US$314 million in 2007; participation in the same year was estimated at 6.9 million (ages 6 or older, 2% of US population).[42] R. A. Court, CEO of Martial Arts Channel, stated the total revenue of the US martial arts industry at US$40 billion and the number of US practitioners at 30 million in 2003.[43]\n\nEquipment[edit]\nMartial arts equipment can include that which is used for conditioning, protection and weapons. Specialized conditioning equipment can include breaking boards, dummy partners such as the wooden dummy, and targets such as punching bags and the makiwara. Protective equipment for sparring and competition includes boxing gloves, headgear and mouthguards.[44]\n\nMartial arts fraud[edit]\n\nAsian martial arts experienced a surge of popularity in the West during the 1970s, and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools. Fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies, this led to the ninja craze of the 1980s in the United States.[45] There were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs, inserted into comic books circa the 1960s and 1970s, which were read primarily by adolescent boys.[46]\nIn the seventies, lower ranks (kyu) began to be given colorful belts to show progress. This proved to be commercially viable and colored-belt systems were adopted in many martial arts degree mills (also known as McDojos and belt factories) as a means to generate additional cash. This was covered in the Penn & Teller: Bullshit! episode \"Martial Arts\" (June 2010).[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nMartial arts portal\nMartial arts timeline\nHistory of martial arts\nList of martial arts\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"martial art | Definition, History, Types, & Facts\".

It includes other activities that involve movement; for example cleaning, working, active transport etc.\nPhysical activity  is defined as any voluntary bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure.[1] Physical activity encompasses all activities, at any intensity, performed during any time of day or night.[2] It includes both exercise and incidental activity integrated into daily routine. This integrated activity may not be planned, structured, repetitive or purposeful for the improvement of fitness, and may include activities such as walking to the local shop, cleaning, working, active transport etc. Lack of physical activity is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, whereas increased physical activity can improve physical and mental health, as well as cognitive and cardiovascular health.[3] There are at least eight investments that work to increase population-level physical activity, including whole-of-school programmes, active transport, active urban design, healthcare, public education and mass media, sport for all, workplaces and community-wide programmes.[4][5] Physical activity increases energy expenditure and is a key regulator in controlling body weight (see Summermatter cycle for more).[6]\n\n\nTerminology misconception[edit]\n\"Exercise\" and \"physical activity\" are frequently used interchangeably and generally refer to physical activity performed during leisure time with the primary purpose of improving or maintaining physical fitness, physical performance, or health. However, physical activity is not exactly the same concept as exercise. Exercise is defined as a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the objective.[1] Conversely, physical activity includes exercise but may also be unplanned, unstructured, random and non-purposeful carried out for a multitude of reasons. \n\nIntensity of physical activities on a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous physical activity. A 2021 study shows that people who start successful physical activity programmes maintain much of it for at least three months.[7]\nIntensity[edit]\nPhysical activity can be at any intensity, from a simple twitch of a muscle to an all-out sprint. In practice, physical activity can be viewed as a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous intensity activity. Intensities are broadly categorized according to energy expenditure using a standard measure of intensity, metabolic equivalents (METs). The broad categories are sedentary behavior, light activity, moderate activity and vigorous activity.\n\nExample activities at each intensity[edit]\nThe following table documents some examples of physical activities at each intensity level. Depending on the individual and the activity involved, activities may overlap intensity categories or change categories completely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity\n\nExample Activities\n\n\nSedentary Behavior\n\nSitting, lying\n\n\nStanding\n\nStanding still\n\n\nLight Physical Activity (LPA)\n\nSlow walking, shuffling around the house\n\n\nModerate Physical Activity (MPA)\n\nBrisk walking, jogging, light swimming, stair climbing\n\n\nVigorous Physical Activity (VPA)\n\nFast running, fast cycling, sprinting\n\nPhysical activity as prevention and therapy[edit]\nPhysical activity is a cornerstone of public health and prevention of non-communicable disease. Physical inactivity has been found to cause a wide range of non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus and depression.[8] An analysis of the healthcare costs of non-communicable diseases and mental illess attributable to physical inactivity for 2020–30 found that 500 million new cases of disease will occur globally between 2020 and 2030 if physical activity remains at today’s levels. This corresponds to more than US$300 billion in treatment costs [9]\nMany studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of physical activity on the prevention and therapy of many disorders as Obesity[10][11] and Irritable bowel syndrome [12][13] \nPhysical activity has been shown to reduce anxiety as a condition (individual physical exercise, without continuity), anxiety as a personality trait (continuous performance, \"exercise\" of certain physical activities), psycho-physiological signs of anxiety - blood pressure and heart rate (moderate physical activity can lead to a decrease in the intensity of short-term physiological reactivity and encourage recovery from short-term physiological stressors (Biddle et al., 2000)).\nFor people with a severe depressive episode and anxiety disorder, long and short walks proved to be the most effective; for people with substance abuse disorders, bipolar disorder and frequent psychotic decompensation, \"strenuous\" gymnastics and riding proved to be the most effective.[medical citation needed] Reducing workplace-base sitting has been shown to address sedentary behaviour in workplace. However, there are few interventions that are cost-effective in reducing occupational sitting time. [14] A study estimated the annual value of nature-based PA conducted in England in 2019 in terms of avoided healthcare and societal costs of six non-communicable diseases (ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer and major depressive disorder) at £108.7million.[15]\n\nPhysical activities during leisure and clusters of different forms of meaningfulness[edit]\nModel over the field of physical activity in terms of clusters of movement cultures with different forms of meaningfulness. From: Lundvall & Schantz 2013.\nDifferent forms of physical activity in leisure time can be divided into different clusters of activities that have a common denominator in the form of type of meaningfulness, se model to the right (Lundvall & Schantz 2013).[16]\nThese separate forms of meaningfulness consist of (i) competition and championship, (ii) nature encounters, (iii) aesthetic-expressive, (iv) fitness gymnastics and play, (v) everyday exercise and (vi) five different basic forms of physical training (aerobic, anaerobic, strength, flexibility and coordination training).\nHow these different clusters have been treated over time from 1813 to today in a context of teacher training for physical education in the Swedish school system has been described by the Swedish professors in human movement science Suzanne Lundvall & Peter Schantz (2013).[17]\n\nRecommendations for physical activity (including sleep and sedentary behavior)[edit]\nGlobal recommendations[edit]\nThe World Health Organization recommend the following:[1]\n\nAdults aged 18–64[edit]\nRunning in waterWeight training\n1. Adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.\n2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration.\n3. For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.\n4. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week.\n\nAdults aged 65+[edit]\n1. Adults aged 65 years and above should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.\n2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration.\n3. For additional health benefits, adults aged 65 years and above should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity activity.\n4. Adults of this age group, with poor mobility, should perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.\n5. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups, on 2 or more days a week.\n6. When adults of this age group cannot do the recommended amounts of physical activity due to health conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow.\n\nChildren and Adolescents aged 5–17[edit]\n1. Children and youth aged 5–17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily.\n2. Amounts of physical activity greater than 60 minutes provide additional health benefits.\n\nCountry-level recommendations[edit]\nAustralia,[18] New Zealand,[19] the United Kingdom,[20] Canada[21] and the United States[22] are among the countries that have issued physical activity recommendations.\n\nPredictors of physical activity levels[edit]\nThe amount of physical activity conducted by a population—and by extension the proportion of that population reaching guidelines or other specified thresholds—is dictated by a number of factors including demographics (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity), population health status, cultural aspects, and the state of the environment itself (e.g. infrastructure that affords physical activity). Demographic groups can also intersect, increasing risk to individuals who are both female and socially disadvantaged for example.[23]\nStudies have shown that as availability of natural environments (e.g., parks, woodlands, inland waters, coasts) increases, more leisure-time physical activity such as walking and cycling are reported.[24] Meteorological conditions have been found to predict physical activity differently in different types of environment. For example, in a large population-based study in England, higher air temperatures and lower wind speeds were associated with increased physical activity.[25]\nGlobally, in 2016, according to a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys, around 81% of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active.[26] The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific.[26]\n\nAs a health indicator[edit]\nInsufficient physical activity among adults (2016)\nPhysical activity, qualified in the form of a physical activity vital sign (PAVS) metric, has been proposed as a screening tool in primary care diagnostics.[27] It has been suggested to correspond with BMI[28] and chronic disease, when coupled with demographic information[27] as well as a tool for identifying patients who do not meet certain physical activity guidelines.[29] Generally, this metric is evaluated by a self-reported medical questionnaire, which can significantly affect the validity and applicability of a PAVS in clinical treatment determination.[27][29]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPhysical inactivity\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jump up to: a b c Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health, 2009.

Association football, shown above, is a team sport which also provides opportunities to nurture physical fitness and social interaction skills.\nThe 2005 London Marathon: running races, in their various specialties, represent the oldest and most traditional form of sport.\nSport is a form of physical activity or game.[1] Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a \"tie\" or \"draw\", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Some organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic Games recognises both chess and bridge as sports. SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts, Go and xiangqi.[4][5] However, they limit the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1] Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.\nAccording to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.[6] The world\'s most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.[7]\n\n\nMeaning and usage\nEtymology\nThe word \"sport\" comes from the Old French desport meaning \"leisure\", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being \"anything humans find amusing or entertaining\".[8]\nOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.[9] Roget\'s defines the noun sport as an \"activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement\" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.[10]\n\nNomenclature\nThe singular term \"sport\" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. \"children taking part in sport\"), with \"sports\" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. \"football and rugby are the most popular sports in England\"). American English uses \"sports\" for both terms.[citation needed]\n\nDefinition\nSee also: Game § Definitions\nThe International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports, including chess.\nShow jumping, an equestrian sport\nThe precise definition of what differentiates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.\nGAISF uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:[1]\n\nhave an element of competition\nbe in no way harmful to any living creature\nnot rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)\nnot rely on any \"luck\" element specifically designed into the sport.\nThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as snooker and other cue sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).[1]\nThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.[11] Whilst GAISF recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.\nThere has been an increase in the application of the term \"sport\" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called esports (from \"electronic sports\"), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to Council of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i, \"\'Sport\' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.\"[12]\n\nCompetition\nHorse racing\nThere are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or GAISF.[1]\nOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.[citation needed]\nIn order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days, although moves like this are often controversial.[13][14]\nIn competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their \"result\" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with \"handicaps\" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of sport\nRoman bronze reduction of Myron\'s Discobolos, 2nd century AD\nSwimmers perform squats as warm-up exercise prior to entering the pool in a U.S. military base, 2011.\nArtifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC.[15] Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China\'s ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.[16] Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zoorkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills.[17] Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting. The traditional South Asian sport of kabaddi has been played for thousands of years, potentially as a preparation for hunting.[18]\n\nMotorised sports have appeared since the advent of the modern age.\nA wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia.[19]\nSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought motorised transportation and increased leisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport\'s popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sports people should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition gender identity.[20]\n\nFair play\nSportsmanship\nMain article: Sportsmanship\nSee also: Gamesmanship, Winning isn\'t everything; it\'s the only thing, and Moral development\nSportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.[21][22][23]\nSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice, that it is \"not that you won or lost but how you played the game\", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: \"The most important thing... is not winning but taking part\" are typical expressions of this sentiment.[citation needed]\n\nCheating\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nSee also: Match fixing and cheating\nKey principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.\nParticipants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports events creates a motivation for match fixing, where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.\n\nDoping and drugs\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport\nThe competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.\nAll sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.[citation needed]\n\nViolence\nViolence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. Rioting or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.[citation needed]\n\nParticipation\nGender participation\nSee also: Women\'s sports and Women\'s professional sports\nInternational level female athletes at ISTAF Berlin, 2006\nFemale participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child development and physical fitness. Despite increases in female participation during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrolment figures between male and female players in sports-related teams. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics.[citation needed]\nCertain sports are mixed-gender, allowing (or even requiring) men and women to play on the same team. One example of this is Baseball5, which is the first mixed-gender sport to have been admitted into an Olympic event.[24]\n\nYouth participation\nSee also: College sports\nYouth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and athletic scholarships. Activists for education and the war on drugs encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation and to fight the illegal drug trade. According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children\'s Hospital, the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.[25] Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.[26]\n\nDisabled participation\nSee also: Parasports\nA runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the Marathon International de Paris (Paris Marathon) in 2014.\nDisabled or adaptive sports are played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of people with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as adapted sports. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for people with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.[citation needed]\n\nSpectator involvement\nMain article: Spectator sport\nSpectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games\nThe competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport.\nBoth amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including radio, television and internet broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or pay-per-view television broadcast. Sports league and tournament are two common arrangements to organise sport teams or individual athletes into competing against each other continuously or periodically.[citation needed]\nIt is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain events. The football World Cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India alone.[27]\nIn the United States, the championship game of the NFL, the Super Bowl, has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.[28][29]\nSuper Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America;[30][31] the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at $4.5m for a 30-second slot.[28]\n\nAmateur and professional\nSee also: Professional sport and Amateur sport\nWomen\'s volleyball team of a U.S. university\nSport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or salary). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called \"grassroots sport\".[2][32]\nThe popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.[33]\nSome sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport. The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.[34] From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,[35] and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,[35][36] with the exceptions of boxing,[37][38] and wrestling.[39][40]\n\nTechnology\nThese lights at the Melbourne Cricket Ground indicate the decision the third umpire makes following a review.\nTechnology plays an important part in modern sport. It is a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), and it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.\nSports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear. Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to wearable technology.[41] In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers\' performances.[42][43]\nThe increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In Association football, goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.[44] The technology is not compulsory,[45] but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,[46] and the 2015 FIFA Women\'s World Cup in Canada,[47] as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14,[48] and the Bundesliga from 2015–16.[49] In the NFL, a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays. The final decision rests with the referee.[50] A video referee (commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (both league and union).[51][52] In international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision.[53][54] Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICC-run tournaments, and optionally in other matches.[53][55] Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review, including instant replays, Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer.[56][57] Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions.[58][59]\n\nSports and education\nResearch suggests that sports have the capacity to connect youth to positive adult role models and provide positive development opportunities, as well as promote the learning and application of life skills.[60][61] In recent years the use of sport to reduce crime, as well as to prevent violent extremism and radicalization, has become more widespread, especially as a tool to improve self-esteem, enhance social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose.[61]\nThere is no high-quality evidence that shows the effectiveness of interventions to increase sports participation of the community in sports such as mass media campaigns, educational sessions, and policy changes.[62] There is also no high-quality studies that investigate the effect of such interventions in promoting healthy behaviour change in the community.[63]\nsports is one of the important part of life\n\nPolitics\nMain article: Politics and sports\nSee also: Sportswashing\nBenito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy, to showcase Fascist Italy.[64][65] Adolf Hitler also used the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority of the Aryan race, and inferiority of the Jews and other \"undesirables\".[65][66] Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.[67]\nWhen apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sports people, particularly in rugby union, adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.[68]\nIn the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism. Until the mid-20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported Association football, or other games seen to be of British origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,[69] is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.[70]\nNationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants. Sport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the Munich massacre.[citation needed]\nA study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 per cent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.[71] Also, when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election, then the incumbent president is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the Redskins Rule.[72][73]\n\nAs a means of controlling and subduing populations\nÉtienne de La Boétie, in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.\n\n\nDo not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.[74]\n\nDuring the British rule of Bengal, British and European sports began to supplant traditional Bengali sports, resulting in a loss of native culture.[75][76]\nReligious views\nMain article: New Testament athletic metaphors\nThe foot race was one of the events dedicated to Zeus. Panathenaic amphora, Kleophrades painter, c. 500 BC, Louvre museum.\nSport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religion. The ancient Olympic Games were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods.[77]\nThe practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.\"[78] Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolised at the expense of divine worship.[78]\nTertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting \"the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry.\"[79] The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:\n\n\nGod has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.[80]\n\n\nChristian clerics in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement oppose the viewing of or participation in professional sports, believing that professional sports leagues profane the Sabbath as in the modern era, certain associations hold games on the Lord\'s Day.[81] They also criticise professional sports for its fostering of a commitment that competes with a Christian\'s primary commitment to God in opposition to 1 Corinthians 7:35, what they perceive to be a lack of modesty in the players\' and cheerleaders\' uniforms (which are not in conformity with the Methodistic doctrine of outward holiness), its association with violence in opposition to Hebrews 7:26, what they perceive to be the extensive use of profanity among many players that contravenes Colossians 3:8–10, and the frequent presence of gambling, as well as alcohol and other drugs at sporting events, which go against a commitment to teetotalism.[81]\n\nSee also\n\nSports portal\n\nOutline of sports\nList of sports\nList of sportspeople\nList of sports attendance figures\nList of professional sports leagues\nNew Media and Sports\n\nRelated topics\n\n\nAthletic sports\nAnimals in sport\nCombat sport\nDisabled sports\nElectronic sports\nFan (person)\nGame\nHandedness#Advantage in sports\nInternational sport\nLawn game\nMind sport\nMotor sports\nMulti-sport events\nNational sport\nNationalism and sports\nOlympic Games\nParalympic Games\nPhysical education\nPhysical fitness\nSpalding Athletic Library\nSponsorship\nSport in film\nSport psychology\nSports club\nSports coaching\nSports commentator\nSports entertainment\nSports equipment\nSports fan\nSports governing body\nSports injuries\nSports league attendances\nSports marketing\nSports nutrition\nSports terms named after people\nSports trainer\nSportsperson\nSportswear\nSunday sporting events\nTeam sport\nUnderwater sports\nWomen\'s sports\nWater sports\nWinter sport\n\nSources\n This article incorporates text from a free content work.
